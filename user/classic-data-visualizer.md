# Classic Data Visualizer (deprecated)

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_vis-->

This chapter refers to the legacy version of the data visualizer. For
the current version, please refer to the [new data visualizer](./data_visualizer.html)
chapter.

## About the Classic Data Visualizer app

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_vis_intro-->

![](resources/images/visualizer/column_chart.png)

With the ** Classic Data Visualizer** app, you can select content, for example
indicators, data elements, periods and organisation units, for an
analysis. The app works well over poor Internet connections and
generates charts in the web browser.

> **Tip**
>
>   - Hide and show individual data series in the chart by clicking
>     directly on the series label in the chart. They appear either at
>     the top or to the right of the chart.
>
>   - Click the triple left-arrow button on the top centre menu. This
>     collapses the left side menu and gives more space for the chart.
>     You can get the menu back by clicking on the same button again.

## Create a chart

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:datavis_create_chart-->

1.  Open the **Classic Data Visualizer** app and select a chart type.

2.  In the menu to the left, select the metadata you want to analyse.
    You must select one or more elements from all of the three
    dimensions - data (indicators, data elements, reporting rates),
    periods (relative, fixed) and organisation units (units or groups).

    > **Note**
    >
    > If you've access to the system settings, you can change the
    > default period type under **General settings \> Default relative
    > period for analysis.**

    **Last 12 Months** from the period dimension and the root
    organisation unit are selected by default.

3.  Click **Layout** and arrange the dimensions.

    You can keep the default selection if you want.

4.  Click **Update**.

## Select a chart type

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:datavis_chart_types-->

The **Classic Data Visualizer** app has nine different chart types, each with
different characteristics. To select a chart type:

1.  In **Chart type**, click the chart type you need.

## Select dimension items

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_vis_select_dim_items-->

A dimension refers to the elements which describe the data values in the
system. There are three main dimensions in the system:

  - Data: Includes data elements, indicators and datasets (reporting
    rates), describing the phenomena or event of the data.

<!-- end list -->

  - Periods: Describes when the event took place.

<!-- end list -->

  - Organisation units: Describes where the event took place.

The Classic Data Visualizer app lets you use these dimensions completely
flexible in terms of appearing as series, categories and filter.

> **Note**
>
> You can select dimension items in different ways:
>
>   - Double-click a dimension item name.
>
>   - Highlight one or several dimension items and click the
>     single-arrow.
>
>   - To select all dimension items in a list, click the double-arrow.
>
>   - To clear dimension items, use the arrows or double-click the names
>     in the **Selected** list.

### Select indicators

The Classic Data Visualizer app can display any number of indicators and data
elements in a chart. You can select both indicators and data elements to
appear together in the same chart, with their order of appearance the
same as the order in which they are selected.

1.  Click **Data** and select **Indicators**.

2.  Select an indicator group.

    The indicators in the selected group appear in the **Available**
    list.

3.  Select one or several indicators by double-clicking the name.

    The indicator moves to the **Selected** list.

### Select data elements

The Classic Data Visualizer app can display any number of indicators and data
elements in a chart. You can select both indicators and data elements to
appear together in the same chart, with their order of appearance the
same as the order in which they are selected.

1.  Click **Data** and select **Data elements**.

2.  Select a data element group.

    The data elements in the selected group appear in the **Available**
    list.

3.  Select one or several data elements by double-clicking the name.

    The data element moves to the **Selected** list.

### Select reporting rates

The Classic Data Visualizer app can display reporting rates in a chart, by
itself or together with indicators and data elements. Reporting rates
are defined by data sets.

1.  Click **Data** and select **Reporting rates**.

    The reporting rates appear in the **Available** list.

2.  Select one or several reporting rates by double-clicking the name.

    The reporting rate moves to the **Selected** list.

### Select fixed and relative periods

1.  Click **Periods**.

2.  Select one or several periods.

    You can combine fixed periods and relative periods in the same
    chart. Overlapping periods are filtered so that they only appear
    once.

      - Fixed periods: In the **Select period type** box, select a
        period type. You can select any number of fixed periods from any
        period type.

    <!-- end list -->

      - Relative periods: In the lower part of the **Periods** section,
        select as many relative periods as you like. The names are
        relative to the current date. This means that if the current
        month is March and you select **Last month**, the month of
        February is included in the chart.

### Select organisation units

1.  Click **Organisation units**.

2.  Click the gearbox icon.

3.  Select a **Selection mode** and an organisation unit.

    There are three different selection modes:

    <table>
    <caption>Selection modes</caption>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 38%" />
    <col style="width: 61%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th><p>Selection mode</p></th>
    <th><p>Description</p></th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Select organisation units</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Lets you select the organisation units you want to appear in the chart from the organization tree.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>User org unit</strong> to disable the organisation unit tree and only select the organisation unit that is related to your profile.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>User sub-units</strong> to disable the organisation unit tree and only select the sub-units of the organisation unit that is related to your profile.</p>
    <p>Select <strong>User sub-x2-units</strong> to disable the organisation unit tree and only select organisation units two levels down from the organisation unit that is related to your profile.</p>
    <p>This functionality is useful for administrators to create a meaningful &quot;system&quot; favorite. With this option checked all users find their respective organisation unit when they open the favorite.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Select levels</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Lets you select all organisation units at one or more levels, for example national or district level.</p>
    <p>You can also select the parent organisation unit in the tree, which makes it easy to select for example, all facilities inside one or more districts.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p><strong>Select groups</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>Lets you select all organisation units inside one or several groups and parent organisation units at the same time, for example hospitals or chiefdoms.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

4.  Click **Update**.

### Select additional dimension items

Depending on the settings for your organisation unit group sets and data
element group sets, you can select additional dimension items from the
left menu.

Here you can add dimension items such as age, sex, etc. without having
to add them as detailed data element selections. This is useful when you
want to separate these categories in your analysis.

The additional dimension items you select are available in **Chart
layout** as dimensions.

## Select series, category and filter

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_vis_series_category_filter-->

![](resources/images/visualizer/chart_layout.png)

You can define which dimension of the data you want to appear as series,
category and filter.

1.  Click **Layout**.

2.  Drag and drop the dimensions to the appropriate space. Only one
    dimension can be in each section.

3.  Click **Update**.

![](resources/images/visualizer/series_category_filter.png)

  - Series: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (for
    example periods or data elements) which you want to visualize in
    order to emphasize trends or relations in its data.

  - Categories: A category is a set of elements (for example indicators
    or organisation units) for which you want to compare its data.

  - Filter: The filter selection will filter the data displayed in the
    chart. Note that if you use the data dimension as filter, you can
    only specify a single indicator or data set as filter item, whereas
    with other dimension types you can select any number of items.

You can download the data source behind a chart in JSON, XML, Excel,
CSV, JXRML or Raw data SQL formats with different identification schemes
(ID, Code, and Name). The data document uses identifiers of the
dimension items and opens in a new browser window to display the URL of
the request to the Web API in the address bar. This is useful for
developers of apps and other client modules based on the DHIS2 Web API
or for those who require a plan data source, for instance for import
into statistical packages.

To download plain data source formats:

## Embed charts in any web page

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_vis_embedding-->

Certain analysis-related resources in DHIS2, like pivot tables, charts
and maps, can be embedded in any web page by using a plug-in. You will
find more information about the plug-ins in the Web API chapter in the
*DHIS2 Developer Manual*.

To generate a HTML fragment that you can use to display the chart in an
external web page:

1.  Click **Share** \> **Embed in web page**.

    The **Embed in web page** window opens.

2.  Click **Select** to highlight the HTML fragment.

## Open a chart as a pivot table or as a map

  - Open a **Chart** and click **Chart** or click **Map**.

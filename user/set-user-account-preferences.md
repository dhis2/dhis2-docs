In **User settings**, you can change the display language of DHIS2 and
the language of the database. The database language is the translated
content of the metadata, such as data elements and indicators. You can
also choose a display style, and enable or disable SMS and email 
notifications. If you wish to, you can choose to display a short name,
such as "Joe" in the analysis modules, rather than your full name.

In **User profile**, you can add personal information to your profile
such as your email address, mobile phone number, date of birth, profile 
picture and more. When you send messages, the person receiving the message can see these
profile details. You can also provide account names for various direct
messaging services, which will be used by the system.

In **Account settings**, you can reset your password and setup 2-Factor
authentication. Setting up 2-Factor authentication will require you to
download the Google Authenticator app on you mobile device.

In the **View full profile** section, you find a summary of your profile details.
This section includes a few fields that you cannot edit yourself,
such as user roles and user organisation units.


In the **About DHIS2** section, you find a list of details about the DHIS2 instance.

# About the DHIS2 Health Data Toolkit 

Developed in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, CDC and other global health partners, the DHIS2 Health Data Toolkit is a set of curated resources for implementing DHIS2 to meet common public health use cases. These resources and tools are developed to support integrated health information system architectures, accelerate country implementation and improve the quality of national systems. Resources include system design & configuration guides, software feature descriptions, tailored training materials, user guides, and reference metadata. The toolkit brings together [WHO data standards](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/health-service-data/toolkit-for-routine-health-information-system-data/modules) with UiO's evidence-based system design principles and implementation lessons to help countries leap-frog into an era of digital information at-their-fingertips.

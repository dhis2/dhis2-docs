# About the WHO Health Data Toolkit 
The WHO health data toolkit for DHIS2 provides reference metadata, example DHIS2 configurations, system design, configuration and implementation guidance to facilitate the dissemination of health data standards at global scale. The toolkit is an extension of the [WHO's toolkit for strengthening routine health information systems](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/analysis-use-health-facility-data). The toolkit brings together WHO standards with UiO's evidence-based system design principles and implementation lessons to help countries leap-frog into an era of digital information at-their-fingertips. The toolkit supports an ever-growing number of national health programs to digitize and integrate their health data according to WHO standards and best practices.

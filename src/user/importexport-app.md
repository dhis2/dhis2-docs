# Import/Export App { #import_export }

In a primary health system, the HMIS typically involves a distributed
application, where the same application is running in different
geographical locations (PHCs,CHCs, hospitals, districts, and state).
Many of these physical locations do not have Internet connectivity, and
hence they work off-line. At some point (normally at the district
level), the data needs to be synchronised in order to have a
consolidated database for the a particular geographical region. For
this, it is important to be able to export data from one location (which
is working offline, say at the health facility level) and import into
another one (say at the district level).
This feature of exporting and importing is thus a crucial function of a HMIS.
This feature also helps us overcome the dependency on the Internet to some
degree, as data updates can be transferred via USB key where there is no
connectivity, or through email where there is limited Internet
connectivity. DHIS2 provides robust export-import functionality to
fulfil these needs.

To access the Import/Export app, search in the top header bar for
Import/Export. Import/Export app offers a number of services details for
which can be found below.

## Importing data { #importing_data }

### Import progress logger { #import_progress_logger }

No matter what you import ("Data", "Events", "Org unit geometry", "Metadata" or
"Tracked Entity Instances" data), you can always view the progress of
the import by looking at the "Job Summary" at the top of the page.

### Import Summaries { #metadata_import_summaries }

On import request completion, we show import summaries above the
import form. Any conflicts or errors are shown in the table under the
main summary for the import.

![](resources/images/import_export/import_summary.png)

### Metadata Import { #metadata_import }

Metadata Import can be accessed from the sidebar by clicking on
Metadata Import.

![](resources/images/import_export/metadata_import.png)

1.  Choose a file to upload

2.  Select a format: _JSON_ , _CSV_, or _XML_

3.  Select the appropriate settings for:

    - Identifier
    - Import report mode
    - Preheat mode
    - Import strategy
    - Atomic mode
    - Merge mode

4.  Click **Advanced options** if you want to adjust one or more of
    the following settings before importing:

    - Flush mode
    - Skip sharing
    - Skip validation
    - Async
    - Inclusive strategy

5.  Click on the **Import** button which will upload the file and start the
    importing process.

> **Tip**
>
> **It is highly recommend to use the Dry run option** to test before
> importing data; to make sure you keep control over any changes to your
> Metadata, and to check for problems with out-of-sync data elements or
> organisation unit names

> **Note**
>
> If an organisation unit e.g. `Nduvuibu MCHP` had a unknown reference to an object with ID `aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn`, it means that the object with ID `aaaU6Kr7Gtpidn` was not present in your imported file, and it was not found in the existing database.
>
> You can control this using **Identifier** option, to indicate if you want to allow objects with such invalid references to be imported or not. If you choose to import invalid references you will have to correct the reference manually in DHIS2 later.

#### Matching Identifiers in DXF2 { #matching_identifiers_in_dxf2 }

The DXF2 format currently support matching for two identifiers, the
internal DHIS2 identifier (known as a UID), and also using an external
identifier called called a "code". When the importer is trying to search
for references (like the one above), it will first go to the UID field,
and then to the code field. This allows you to import from legacy
systems without having a UID for every meta-data object. I.e. if you are
importing facility data from a legacy system, you can leave out the ID
field completely (DHIS2 will fill this in for you) and put the
legacy system's own identifiers in the code field, this identifier is
required to be unique. This not only works for organisation units, but
for all kinds of meta-data, allowing for easy import from other systems.

### Data Import { #import }

#### PDF Data { #importPDFdata }

DHIS2 supports import of data in the PDF format. This can be used to
import data produced by off-line PDF data entry forms. Please refer to
the section **Data set management** for details on how to produce a PDF
form which can be used for off-line data entry.

To import a PDF data file, navigate to the _PDF Data Import_ item in the
side menu. Upload the completed PDF file and click _Import_.

### Event Import { #event_import }

Event Import can be accessed from the sidebar by clicking on Event
Import.

![](resources/images/import_export/event_import.png)

1.  Select a format: _JSON_ , _CSV_, or _XML_

2.  Click **Advanced options** if you want to adjust one or more of
    the following settings before importing:

    - Event ID scheme
    - Data element ID scheme

3.  Click on the **Import** button which will upload the file and start the
    importing process.

### Earth Engine Import { #ee_import }

Earth Engine Import can be accessed from the sidebar by clicking on Earth Engine
Import.

Import high resolution population data from WorldPop using Google Earth Engine. A [Google
Earth Engine account](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/topics/tutorials/google-earth-engine-sign-up.html) is required to use this importer.

![](resources/images/import_export/ee_import.png)

#### Select which Earth Engine data should be imported

The first section of the form is used to configure the Earth Engine data to import.

1. Select which Earth Engine dataset should be imported. Currently the choices are *Population* and *Population age groups*.

2. After a dataset has been selected, a period must be selected. Only one period can be imported at a time.

3. Choose how the data should be rounded. By default data is not rounded.

4. Select which organisation units to import data to. If you select facility level organisation units, then you must choose an associated geometry for the facilities. Without an associated geometry for facilities, the Earth Engine cannot determine the population.

![](resources/images/import_export/ee_ou_associated_geometry.png)

#### Select the data elements to import the Earth Engine data into

Once you have configured the Earth Engine dataset, you need to select which data element to import the data to. For datasets with disaggregation groups, such as "Population age groups", the DHIS2 data element must have disaggregations in the form of category option combos that match the Earth Engine dataset disaggregation groups.

![](resources/images/import_export/ee_group_coc_mapping.png)

> **Configuring data elements for Earth Engine import**
>
> When configuring the DHIS2 data elements that will contain Earth Engine data, if you plan to import data to multiple org unit levels, ensure that those levels are added as Aggregation Levels in the data element configuration.
>
> Some Earth Engine datasets contain disaggregation groups, the DHIS2 data element must be configured with corresponding category option combos. For example the "Population age groups" dataset is disaggregated by gender (Male, Female) and 5-year age groups.
>
> In DHIS2 this means that you must have a Male/Female category, and a 5-year age group category (<1yr, 1-4yr, 5-9yr, 10-14yr... 80+yr). These are combined into a category combination.
>
> Pro-tip: To automatically match the category option combo to the Earth Engine disaggregation group, add a Code to each category option combo that matches the earth engine group name. For example, with "Population age groups", the groups are named: F_0, F_1, F_5..., M_0, M_1, M_5...

#### Run the import

Once the data element and category option combos have been selected, the Preview button is enabled. After reviewing the data you want to import, you can do a dry run first, or proceed with the actual import.

![](resources/images/import_export/ee_data_preview.png)

### Organisation Unit Geometry Import { #geometry_import }

Accessed from the sidebar by clicking on _Org Unit geometry import_. Two
geometry formats are supported: GeoJSON and GML. GeoJSON is the
recommended format and can also be used to import associated geometries
(catchment areas).

#### GeoJSON import { #geojson_import }

![](resources/images/import_export/geojson_import.png)

1.  Upload a file using the GeoJSON format.

2.  By default the GeoJSON feature id should match the organisation unit id.

3.  Check **Match GeoJSON property to organisation unit scheme** to match by
    a feature propery. Type the GeoJSON property name and select the
    Organisation unit ID scheme (_Id_, _Code_ or _Name_).

4.  Check **Import as associated geometry** to import the GeoJSON features
    as associated geometries the organisation units (e.g. catchment areas).
    Select at geometry attribute where the data should be imported. This requires
    an attribure of type _GeoJSON_ applied to _Organisatiot unit_. This
    attribute can be defined in the Maintenance app.

5.  Click on the **Start import** button which will upload the file and start the
    importing process.

> **Tip**

## Schemes

The various schemes used in many of the import and export pages are
also known as identifier schemes and are used to map metadata objects
to other metadata during import, and to render metadata as part of
exports.

Table: Available values

| Scheme       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ID, UID      | Match on DHIS2 stable Identifier, this is the default id scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| CODE         | Match on DHIS2 Code, mainly used to exchange data with an external system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| NAME         | Match on DHIS2 Name, please note that this uses what is available as _object.name_, and not the translated name. Also note that names are not always unique, and in that case, they can not be used.                                                                                                                                                                |
| ATTRIBUTE:ID | Match on metadata attribute, this attribute needs to be assigned to the type you are matching on, and also that the unique property is set to _true_. The main usage of this is also to exchange data with external systems, it has some advantages over _CODE_ since multiple attributes can be added, so it can be used to synchronize with more than one system. |

### ID scheme

The ID scheme applies to all types of objects, but can be overwritten
by more specific object types.

## About the Data Exchange app { #about_data_exchange }

The data exchange app allows for exchanging data between the DHIS 2 instance where the app is installed and a target instance of DHIS 2, or other software that are capable of importing the DHIS 2 data value set format. Data can also be exchanged within a DHIS 2 instance, for instance for aggregation of tracker data and saving the result as aggregate data.

To exchange data, at least one _aggregate data exchange_ must be configured in the system. Please consult the _Aggregate data exchange_ section in the _Data exchange_ chapter in the Developer guide for a detailed explanation.

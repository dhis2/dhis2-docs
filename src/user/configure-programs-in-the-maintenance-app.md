## About programs { #about_program_maintenance_app } 

Traditionally, public health information systems have been reporting
aggregated data of service provision across its health programs. This
does not allow you to trace the people provided with these services. In
DHIS2, you can define your own programs with stages. These programs are
a essential part of the "tracker" functionality which lets you track
individual records. You can also track other ‘entities’ such as wells or
insurances. You can create two types of programs:



Table: Program types

| Program type | Description | Examples of use |
|---|---|---|
| Event program | Single event *without* registration program (anonymous program or SEWoR)<br> <br>Anonymous, individual events are tracked through the health system. No person or entity is attached to these individual transactions.<br> <br>Has only one program stage. | To record health cases without registering any information into the system.<br> <br>To record survey data or surveillance line-listing. |
| Tracker program | Single event *with* registration program (SEWR)<br> <br>An entity (person, commodity, etc.) is tracked through each individual transaction with the health system<br> <br>Has only one program stage.<br> <br>A tracked entity instance (TEI) can only enroll in the program once. | To record birth certificate and death certificate. |
|| Multi events *with* registration program (MEWR)<br> <br>An entity (person, commodity, etc.) is tracked through each individual transaction with the health system<br> <br>Has multiple program stages. | Mother Health Program with stages as ANC Visit (2-4+), Delivery, PNC Visit. |

To create a program, you must first configure several types of metadata
objects. You create these metadata objects in the **Maintenance** app.



Table: Program metadata objects in the Maintenance app

| Object type | Description | Available functions |
|---|---|---|
| Event program | A program to record single event without registration | Create, edit, share, delete, show details and translate |
| Tracker program | A program to record single or multiple events with registration | Create, edit, share, delete, show details and translate |
| Program indicator | An expression based on data elements and attributes of tracked entities which you use to calculate values based on a formula. | Create, edit, clone, share, delete, show details and translate |
| Program rule | Allows you to create and control dynamic behaviour of the user interface in the **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture** apps. | Create, edit, clone, delete, show details and translate |
| Program rule variable | Variables you use to create program rule expressions. | Create, edit, clone, delete, show details and translate |
| Relationship type | Defines the relationship between tracked entity A and tracked entity B, for example mother and child. | Create, edit, clone, share, delete, show details and translate |
| Tracked entity type | Types of entities which can be tracked through the system. Can be anything from persons to commodities, for example a medicine or a person.<br> <br>A program must have one tracked entity. To enrol a tracked entity instance into a program, the tracked entity of an entity and tracked entity of a program must be the same.<br>      <br>    **Note**<br>     <br>    A program must be specified with only one tracked entity. Only tracked entity as same as the tracked entity of program can enroll into that program. | Create, edit, clone, share, delete, show details and translate |
| Tracked entity attribute | Used to register extra information for a tracked entity.<br> <br>Can be shared between programs. | Create, edit, clone, share, delete, show details and translate |

## Configure event programs in the Maintenance app { #configure_event_program_in_maintenance_app } 

### About event programs { #about_event_program } 

Single event *without* registration programs are called event programs.
You configure them in the **Maintenance** app. Event programs can have
three types of data entry forms:



Table: Types of data entry forms for event programs

| Form type | Description |
|---|---|
| Basic | Lists all data elements which belong to the program. You can change the order of the data elements. |
| Section | A section groups data elements. You can then arrange the order of the sections to create the desired layout of the data entry form. |
| Custom | Defines the data entry form as HTML page. |

> **Note**
>
>   - Custom forms takes precedence over section forms if both are
>     present.
>
>   - If no custom or section form are defined, the basic form will be
>     used.
>
>   - The Android apps only supports section forms.

You can create *program notifications* for event programs. The
notifications are sent either via the internal DHIS2 messaging system,
via e-mail or via text messages (SMS). You can use program notifications
to, for example, send an automatic reminder to a tracked entity 10 days
before a scheduled appointment. You use the program’s tracked entity
attributes (for example first name) and program parameters (for example
enrollment date) to create a notification template. In the
**Parameters** field, you'll find a list of available tracked entity
attributes and program parameters.

### Workflow: Create an event program { #workflow_event_program } 

1.  Enter the event program details.

2.  Assign data elements.

3.  Create data entry form(s): **Basic**, **Section** or **Custom**.

4.  Assign the program to organisation unit(s).

5.  Create program notification(s).

### Create or edit an event program { #create_event_program } 

#### Enter event program details

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program**.

2.  Click the add button and select **Event Program** in the popup menu.

3.  Enter program details, then click next.


    | Field | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Name** | The name of the program. |
    | **Color** | Color used for this program in the data capture apps. |
    | **Icon** | Icon used for this program in the data capture apps. |
    | **Short name** | A short name of the program. The short name is used as the default chart or table title in the analytics apps. |
    | **Description** | A detailed description of the program. |
    | **Version** | The version of the program. This is used for example when people collect data offline in an Android implementation. When they go online and synchronize their metadata, they should get the latest version of the program. |
    | **Category combination** | The category combination you want to use. The default setting is **None**. |
    | **Data approval workflow** | The data approval workflow you want to use. The default setting is **No value**. |
    | **Completed events expiry date** | Defines the number of days for which you can edit a completed event. This means that when an event is completed and the specified number of expiry days has passed, the event is locked.<br>     <br>If you set "Completed events expiry days" to 10", an event is locked ten days after the completion date. After this date you can no longer edit the event. |
    | **Expiry period type**<br>     <br>**Expiry days** | The expiry days defines for how many days after the end of the previous period, an event can be edited. The period type is defined by the expiry period type. This means that when the specified number of expiry days has passed since the end date of the previous period, the events from that period are locked.<br>     <br>If you set the expiry type to "Monthly" and the expiry days to "10" and the month is October, then you can't add or edit an event to October after the 10th of November. |
    | **Block entry form after completed** | Select checkbox to block the entry form after completion of the event of this program.<br>     <br>This means that the data in the entry form can't be changed until you reset the status to incomplete. |
    | **Feature type** | Sets whether the program is going to capture a geographical feature type or not. <br>- **None**   Nothing is captured. <br>- **Polygon**   An area is captured. For single event programs the area will be the area representing the event being captured. For tracker programs, the area will represent the area of the enrollment. <br>- **Point**   A point/coordinate is captured. For single event programs the point will be representing the event being captured. For tracker programs, the point will represent the enrollment.      |
    | **Validation strategy** | Sets the server and client side validation requirement. <br><br>Data type validation is always performed regardless of the validation strategy. An integer field is never stored containing text, for example. <br>- **On complete**  This option will enforce required field and error messages to be fixed when completing the event, but the event can be saved to the server without passing these validation requirements. For legacy reasons, this is always the validation strategy for tracker programs, where each data value in the event is stored to the server while entering data. <br>- **On update and insert**   This option will enforce required field validation when saving the event to the server regardless of the completion status. When using this option no events can be stored without passing validations. |
    | **Pre-generate event UID** | Select checkbox to pre-generate unique event id numbers. |
    | **Description of report date** | Type a description of the report date.<br>     <br>This description is displayed in the case entry form. |

1.  Click next.

    | Setting | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Compulsory** | The value of this data element must be filled into data entry form before you can complete the event. |
    | **Allow provided elsewhere** | Specify if the value of this data element comes from other facility, not in the facility where this data is entered. |
    | **Display in reports** | Displays the value of this data element into the single event without registration data entry function. |
    | **Date in future** | Will allow user to select a date in future for date data elements. |
    | **Mobile render type** | Can be used to select different render types for mobile devices. Available options vary depending on the data element's value type. For example, for a numerical value you may select "Default", "Value", "Slider", "Linear scale", and "Spinner". |
    | **Desktop render type** | WARNING: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.<br>     <br>Can be used to select different render types for desktop (i.e. the web interface). Available options vary depending on the data element's value type. For example, for a numerical value you may select "Default", "Value", "Slider", "Linear scale", and "Spinner". |

4.  Click next.

6.  Click next.

#### Access { #access } 

Access options decide who can capture data for the program or view/edit
the program's metadata. A program can be shared to organisation units,
and in addition, the main program and any program stages' access options
can be configured through the **Sharing dialog**. Access options are
available in the **Access** tab.

Assign organization units:

1.  In the organisation tree, double-click the organisation units you
    want to add to the program to.

    You can locate an organisation unit in the tree by expanding the
    branches (click on the arrow symbol), or by searching for it by
    name. The selected organisation units display in orange.

Change roles and access:

1.  Scroll down to the **Roles and access** section.

    The first row shows the main program's access options, and each
    subsequent row shows the options of one program stage. Program
    stages with a warning icon (exclamation mark) contain access options
    that deviate from the main program, meaning they are accessed by a
    different combination of users.

2.  Click on either of the rows and the **Sharing dialog** will show.

3.  Modify the access options accordingly. See documentation on the
    sharing dialog for details.

4.  Click the **Apply** button.

5.  Repeat the process for each program/program stage. You can also copy
    all access options from the main program to your child programs:

    1.  Select the program stages you want to have similar access
        options as the main program by toggling the checkboxes on the
        right hand side of the program stages. You can also choose to
        **Select all** program stages, **Deselect all** program stages
        or **Select similar** stages, in terms of access options, to
        that of the main program. Similar stages are toggled by default.

    2.  Click **Apply to selected stages**

## Configure tracker programs in the Maintenance app { #configure_tracker_program_in_Maintenance_app } 

### About Tracker programs
Single or multiple event programs *with* registration are called Tracker programs. A program must be specified with only one tracked entity. Only tracked entities that are the same as the tracked entity of program can enroll into that
program. A program needs several types of metadata that you create in the **Maintenance** apps.

### Workflow: Create a tracker program { #workflow_tracker_program } 

1.  Enter the tracker program details.

2.  Enter enrollment details.

3.  Assign attributes and create  **section** or **custom** registration form.

4. Create program stages.

5. Configure access, and assign to organisation units.

6. Create program and program stage notification(s).

### Create or edit a Tracker program

1. Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program**.

2. Click the add button and select **Tracker Program** in the popup menu.

#### Enter program details { #tracker_enter_programs_details }

| **Completed events expiry days** |  Defines the number of days for which you can edit a completed event. This means that when an event is completed and the specified number of expiry days has passed, the event is locked. <br> <br> If you set "Completed events expiry days" to 10", an event is locked ten days after the completion date. After this date you can no longer edit the event.  |
| **Expiry period type**<br> <br>**Expiry days** |  The expiry days defines for how many days after the end of the previous period, an event can be edited. The period type is defined by the expiry period type. This means that when the specified number of expiry days has passed since the end date of the previous period, the events from that period are locked. <br> <br> If you set the expiry type to "Monthly" and the expiry days to "10" and the month is October, then you can't add or edit an event to October after the 10th of November.  |

 | **Generate events by enrollment date** |  Check on it for auto-generating due dates of events from  program-stages of this program based on the enrollment date.  If it is not checked, the due dates are generated based on  incident date.  |
 | **Hide due dates** | Select checkbox to hide due dates for events. |
 | **Feature type** |  Sets whether the program is going to capture a geographical  feature type or not.  <br>  * **None:** Nothing is captured.<br> * **Polygon:** An area is captured. For single  event programs the area will be the area representing the  event being captured. For tracker programs, the area will  represent the area of the enrollment. <br> * **Point:** A point/coordinate is captured. For  single event programs the point will be representing the  event being captured. For tracker programs, the point will  represent the enrollment. |
 | **Pre-generate event UID** | Select check box to pre-generate unique event id numbers. |
 | **Description of report date** | Type a description of the report date.<br>  <br>This description is displayed in the data entry form. |

| **Mobile render type** |                      Can be used to select different render types for mobile                     devices. Available options vary depending on the attribute's                     value type. For example, for a numerical value you may                     select "Default", "Value",                     "Slider", "Linear scale", and                     "Spinner".                  |
| **Desktop render type** | WARNING: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.<br>                 <br>                     Can be used to select different render types for desktop                     (i.e. the web interface). Available options vary depending                     on the attribute's value type. For example, for a numerical                     value you may select "Default", "Value",                     "Slider", "Linear scale", and                     "Spinner".                  |

6. Create data entry forms for program stage

    The data entry forms decide how the data elements will be displayed to
    the user in the **Tracker Capture** app.

   1.  Click **Create data entry form**.

   2.  Click **Basic**, **Section** or **Custom**.

   3.  To create a **Basic** data entry form: Drag and drop the data
       elements in the order you want.

   4.  To create a **Section** data entry form:

       1.  Click the add button and enter a section's name, description and
           render type for desktop and mobile.

       2.  Click the section so it's highlighted by a black border.

           elements' names.

       4.  Repeat above steps until you've all the sections you need.

       5.  Change the section order: click the options menu, then drag the
           section to the place you want.

   5.  To create a **Custom** data entry from: Use the WYSIWYG editor to
           create a completely customized form. If you select **Source**, you
           can paste HTML code directly in the editing area. You can also
           insert images for example flags or logos.

   6.  Click add stage.


#### Access { #tracker_program_access } 

Access options decide who can capture data for the program or view/edit
the program's metadata. A program can be shared to organisation units,
and in addition, the main program and any program stages' access options
can be configured through the **Sharing dialog**. Access options are
available in the **Access** tab.

Assign organization units:

1.  In the organisation tree, double-click the organisation units you
    want to add to the program to.

    You can locate an organisation unit in the tree by expanding the
    branches (click on the arrow symbol), or by searching for it by
    name. The selected organisation units display in orange.

Change roles and access:

1.  Scroll down to the **Roles and access** section.

    The first row shows the main program's access options, and each
    subsequent row shows the options of one program stage. Program
    stages with a warning icon (exclamation mark) contain access options
    that deviate from the main program, meaning they are accessed by a
    different combination of users.

2.  Click on either of the rows and the **Sharing dialog** will show.

3.  Modify the access options accordingly. See documentation on the
    sharing dialog for details.

4.  Click the **Apply** button.

5.  Repeat the process for each program/program stage. You can also copy
    all access options from the main program to your child programs:

    1.  Select the program stages you want to have similar access
        options as the main program by toggling the checkboxes on the
        right hand side of the program stages. You can also choose to
        **Select all** program stages, **Deselect all** program stages
        or **Select similar** stages, in terms of access options, to
        that of the main program. Similar stages are toggled by default.

    2.  Click **Apply to selected stages**

#### Create program notifications { #create_tracker_program_notifications } 

You can create program notifications for programs with registration and
their program stages. The notifications are sent either via the internal
DHIS2 messaging system, via e-mail or via text messages (SMS). You can
use program notifications to, for example, send an automatic reminder to
a tracked entity 10 days before a scheduled appointment. You use the
program’s tracked entity attributes (for example first name) and program
parameters (for example enrollment date) to create a notification
template.


1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program and then
    notifications**.

    A list of existing program notifications for the selected program
    opens. If the program doesn't have any program notifications, the

### About program indicators { #about_program_indicators } 

Program indicators are expressions based on data elements and attributes
of tracked entities which can be used to calculate values based on a
formula. Program indicators consist of an aggregation type, an analytics
type, an expression and a filter.

Program indicators are evaluated based on the assigned aggregation type,
expression and filter. The order of evaluation is:

1.  The *filter* will filter the events which become part of the
    evaluation/aggregation routine.

2.  The *expression* will be evaluated per event.

3.  All evaluated expression values will be *aggregated* according to
    the aggregation type of the program indicator.



Table: Program indicator components

| Program rule component | Description |
|---|---|
| Aggregation type | The aggregation type determines how the program indicator will be aggregated. The following aggregation types are available:<br> * Average<br> * Average (number)<br> * Average (number, disaggregation)<br> * Average (sum in organisation unit hierarchy)<br> * Average (sum of numbers)<br> * Average (sum of numbers, disaggregation)<br> * Average (Yes/No)<br> * Count<br> * Custom<br> The "custom" aggregation type allows you to specify the aggregation type in-line in the expression. All other aggregation types are applied to the entire expression.<br> Using the "custom" aggregation type might lead to an exception of the order of evaluation described above where individual parts of the expression can be evaluated and aggregated, as opposed to the entire expression being evaluated prior to aggregation.<br> * Default<br> * Max<br> * Min<br> * None<br> * Standard deviation<br> * Sum<br> * Variance |
| Analytics type | The available analytics types are *event* and *enrollment*.<br> <br>The analytics type defines whether the program indicator is calculated based on events or program enrollments. This has an impact on what type of calculations can be made.<br> * Events implies a data source where each event exists as an independent row. This is suitable for performing aggregations such as counts and sums.<br> * Enrollments implies a data source where all events for a single enrollment is combined on the same row. This allows for calculations which can compare event data from various program stages within a program enrollment. |
| Analytics period boundaries | Defines the boundaries for the program indicator calculation. The boundaries determine which events or enrollments gets included in aggregations, always relative to the aggregate reporting period start and end. When creating the program indicator, the default boundaries will get preselected based on analytics type.<br> * For analytics type *event*, the default boundaries will be configured to encapsulate any events with an event date after the reporting period starts and before the reporting period ends.<br> * For analytics type *enrollment*, the default boundaries will encapsulate all enrollments with an enrollment date after the reporting date starts and before the reporting period ends. In addition, the default enrollment program indicator evaluates the newest event for all program stages regardless of date.<br> <br>It is possible to change the upper and lower boundaries to include a longer or shorter period relative to the reporting period, or delete one of the boundaries - in effect returning all data before or after a certain period. It is also possible to add more constraints, for example to make an enrollment program indicator only include event data up to a given point in time.<br> * Boundary target: Can be *incident date*, *event date*, *enrollment date* or *custom*. Designates what is being constrained by the boundary.<br> <br> *custom* is used make boundary that target either a date data element, tracked entity attribute or the presence of an event in a program stage. This is done with a custom expression on the form:<br> - Data element of type date: #{programStageUid.dataElementUid}.<br> `#{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6}` <br> - Tracked entity attribute of type date: #{attributeUid}.<br> `A{GPkGfbmArby}` <br> - Presence of one event in a specific program stage: PS_EVENTDATE:programStageUid.<br> `PS_EVENTDATE:A03MvHHogjR`  <br> **Note**  This boundary target is only applicable to  Analytics type Enrollment <br> * Analytics period boundary type: Defines whether the boundary is an end boundary - starting with "before...", or a start boundary - "after...". Also defines whether the boundary relates to the end of the aggregate reporting period or the start of the aggregate reporting period.<br> * Offset period by amount: In some cases, for example cohort analytics, the boundary should be offset relative to the aggregate reporting period when running pivots and reports. The offset period by amount is used to move the current boundary either back(negative) or forward(positive) in time. The amount and period type together will determine how big the offset will be. An example can be when making a simple enrollment cohort program indicator for a 1 year cohort, it might be enough to offset each boundary of the program indicator with "-1" and "Years"<br> * Period type: See above. Can be any period, e.g. *Weekly* or *Quarterly*. |
| Expression | The expression defines how the indicator is being calculated. The expression can contain references to various entities which will be substituted with a related values when the indicator is calculated:<br> * Data elements: Will be substituted with the value of the data element for the time period and organisation unit for which the calculation is done. Refers to both program stage and data element.<br> * Attributes: Will be substituted with the value of the attribute for the person / tracked entity for which the calculation is done.<br> * Variables: Will be substituted with special values linked to the program, including incident date and date of enrollment for the person, current date and count of values in the expression for the time period and organisation unit for which the calculation is done.<br> * Constants: Will be substituted with the value of the constant.<br> <br>The expression is a mathematical expression and can also contain operators.<br> <br>For single event programs and tracker programs with analytics type *event*, the expression will be evaluated *per event*, then aggregated according to its aggregation type.<br> <br>For tracker programs with analytics type *enrollment*, the expression will be evaluated *per enrollment*, then aggregated according to its aggregation type. |
| Filter | The filter is applied to events and filters the data source used for the calculation of the indicator. I.e. the filter is applied to the set of events before the indicator expression is being evaluated. The filter must evaluate to either true or false. It filter is applied to each individual event. If the filter evaluates to true then the event is included later in the expression evaluation, if not it is ignored. The filter can, in a similar way as expressions, contain references to data elements, attributes and constants.<br> <br>The program indicator filter can in addition use logical operators. These operators can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately evaluate to either true or false. For example you can assert that multiple data elements must be a specific value, or that specific attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant. |

The table below shows examples of how to write expressions and filters
for different data element and attribute value types:



Table: Expression and filter examples per value type

| Value types | Example syntax |
|---|---|
| Integer<br> <br>Negative integer<br> <br>Positive or zero integer<br> <br>Positive integer<br> <br>Number<br> <br>Percentage | Numeric fields, can be used for aggregation as an expression, or in filters:<br> `#{mCXR7u4kNBW.K0A4BauXJDl} >= 3` |
| Yes/No<br> <br>Yes only | Boolean fields. Yes is translated to numeric 1, No to numeric 0. Can be used for aggregation as an expression, or in filters:<br> `#{mCXR7u4kNBW.Popa3BauXJss} == 1` |
| Text<br> <br>Long text<br> <br>Phone number<br> <br>Email | Text fields. Can be checked for equality in filters:<br> `#{mCXR7u4kNBW.L8K4BauIKsl} == 'LiteralValue'` |
| Date<br> <br>Age | Date fields. Most useful when combined with a d2:daysBetween function, which produces a number that can be aggregated as an expression or used in filters:<br> `d2:daysBetween(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.JKJKBausssl},V{enrollment_date}) > 100` <br>Can also directly be checked for equality in filters:<br> `#{mCXR7u4kNBW.JKJKBausssl} == '2011-10-28'` |

### Reference information: Functions, variables and operators to use in program indicator expressions and filters { #program_indicator_functions_variables_operators } 

An expression that includes both attributes, data elements and constants
looks like this:

    (A{GPkGfbmArby} + #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) * C{bCqvfPR02Im}

An expression which uses the custom aggregation type and hence can use
inline aggregation types looks like
    this:

    (sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.K0A4BauXJDl} * #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) / sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH})) * 100

Note how the "sum" aggregation operator is used inside the expression
itself.

#### Functions to use in a program indicator expression or filter

The program indicator expression and filter support a range of
functions. The functions can be applied to data elements and attributes:



Table: Functions to use in a program indicator expression or filter

| Function | Arguments | Description |
|---|---|---|
| d2:hasValue | (object) | Returns true if the data element/attribute has a value. Can be used in filters to distinguish between the number 0 and no value, and to distinguish between explicit "No" and no selection for a Yes/No field. |
| d2:minutesBetween | (datetime, datetime) | Produces the number of minutes between two data elements/attributes of type "date and time". When the first argument datetime comes before the second argument datetime, the number will be positive - in the opposite case, the number will be negative. The static datetime format is 'yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm'. Any of the arguments can be replaced with PS_EVENTDATE:(programStageUid) to compare the latest event date from a given program stage. |
| d2:daysBetween | (date, date) | Produces the number of days between two data elements/attributes of type date. When the first argument date comes before the second argument date, the number will be positive - in the opposite case, the number will be negative. The static date format is 'yyyy-MM-dd'.

#### Variables to use in a program indicator expression or filter

The program indicator expression and filter support a range of
variables:



Table: Variables to use in a program indicator expression or filter

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| event_date | The date of when the event or the last event in the enrollment took place. |
| creation_date | The date of when an event or enrollment was created in the system. |
| due_date | The date of when an event is due. |
| sync_date | The date of when the event or enrollment was last synchronized with the Android app. |
| incident_date | The date of the incidence of the event. |
| enrollment_date | The date of when the tracked entity instance was enrolled in the program. |
| enrollment_status | Can be used to include or exclude enrollments in certain statuses.<br> <br>When calculating the haemoglobin improvement/deterioration throughout a pregnancy, it might make sense to only consider completed enrollments. If non-completed enrollments is not filtered out, these will represent half-finished ANC followups, where the final improvement/deterioration is not yet established. |
| current_date | The current date. |
| value_count | The number of non-null values in the expression part of the event. |
| zero_pos_value_count | The number of numeric positive values in the expression part of the event. |
| event_count | The count of events (useful in combination with filters). |
| enrollment_count | The count of enrollments (useful in combination with filters). Aggregation type for the program indicator must be COUNT.  |
| tei_count | The count of tracked entity instances (useful in combination with filters). Aggregation type for the program indicator must be COUNT. |
| org_unit_count | The count of organisation units (useful in combination with filters). Aggregation type for the program indicator must be COUNT. |
| program_stage_name | Can be used in filters for including only certain program stages in a filter for tracker programs. Uses the name of the program stage:<br> `V{program_stage_name} == 'ANC first visit'` |
| program_stage_id | Can be used in filters for including only certain program stages in a filter for tracker programs. Uses the unique identifier of the program stage:<br> `V{program_stage_id} == 'YPSSfbmAtt1'` |
| analytics_period_start | Can be used in filters or expressions for comparing any date to the first date in each reporting period.<br> `d2:daysBetween(#{WZbXY0S00lP.w4ky6EkVahL}, V{analytics_period_start})` |
| analytics_period_end | Can be used in filters or expressions for comparing any date to the last inclusive date in each reporting period. |
| event_status | Can be used in filters or expressions for comparing event status.<br> `V{event_status} == 'COMPLETED'` |

A filter that uses the "Analytics period end" variable to only include
women who has an LMP that would be in the first
    trimester:

    d2:daysBetween(#{WZbXY0S00lP.w4ky6EkVahL}, V{analytics_period_end}) <= 84

An expression that uses the "value count" variable looks like
    this:

    (#{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6} + #{A03MvHHogjR.wQLfBvPrXqq}) / V{value_count}

An expression that uses the "event\_date" and "incident\_date" variables
looks like this:

    d2:daysBetween(V{incident_date},V{event_date})

#### Operators to use in a program indicator filter



Table: Operators to use in a program indicator filter

| Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| and | Logical AND |
| or | Logical OR |
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |
| < | Less than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |

These operators can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately
evaluate to either true or false. For example you can assert that
multiple data elements must be a specific value, or that specific
attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant.

A filter that uses both attributes and data elements looks like this:

    A{cejWyOfXge6} == 'Female' and #{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6} <= 2

## Configure program rules { #configure_program_rule } 

### About program rules { #about_program_rules } 

Program rules allows you to create and control dynamic behaviour of the
user interface in the **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture** apps.
During data entry, the program rules expressions are evaluated each time
the user interface is displayed, and each time a data element is
changed. Most types of actions will take effect immediately when the
user enters values in the **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture**
apps.



Table: Program rule components

| Program rule component | Description |
|---|---|
| Program rule action | Each program rule contains one or multiple actions. These are the behaviours that are triggered in the user interface when the expression is true. Actions will be applied at once if the expression is true, and will be reverted if the expression is no longer true. There are several types of actions and you can have several actions in one program rule. |
| Program rule expression | Each program rule has a single expression that determines whether the program rule actions should be triggered, if the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is true the program rule is in effect and the actions will be executed. If the expression is false, the program rule is no longer in effect and the actions will no longer be applied.<br> <br>You create the expression with standard mathematical operators, custom functions, user-defined static values and program rule variables. The program rule variables represent attribute and data element values which will be evaluated as part of the expression. |
| Program rule variable | Program rule variables lets you include data values and attribute values in program rule expressions. Typically, you'll have to create one or several program rule variables before creating a program rule. This is because program rules expressions usually contain at least one data element or attribute value to be meaningful.<br> <br>The program rule variables are shared between all rules in your program. When you create multiple program rules for the same program, these rules will share the same library of program rule variables. |

In the **Maintenance** app, you manage the following program rule
objects:


| Object type | Available functions |
|---|---|
| Program rule | Create, edit, clone, delete, show details and translate |
| Program rule variable | Create, edit, clone, share, delete, show details and translate |

### Workflow { #workflow_program_rule } 

1.  In the **Maintenance** app, create program rule variable(s) if
    needed.

2.  In the **Maintenance** app, create the program rule:

    1.  Enter the program rule details.

    2.  Create the program rule expression.

    3.  Define the program rule actions.

3.  In the **Tracker Capture** or **Event Capture** apps, verify that
    the program rule behaves as expected.

### Create or edit a program rule variable { #create_program_rule_variable } 

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program rule
    variable**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  Select a **Program** and enter a **Name**.

4.  Select if you want to **Use code for option set**.

    This option is only effective when the data element or tracked
    entity attribute is connected to an option set. If you don't select
    this option, the program rule variable will be populated with the
    option set's name. If you select the option, the program rule
    variable will be populated with the option set's code instead.

5.  Select a **Source type** and enter the required information.

    Depending on the source type, you'll have to select, for example, a
    **Program stage,** **Data element** or **Tracked entity attribute**.

    The source types determine how the program rule variable is
    populated with a value.


    | Source type | Description |
    |---|---|
    | **Data element from the newest event for a program stage** | This source type works the same way as **Data element from the newest event in the current program**, except that it only evaluates values from one program stage.<br>     <br>This source type can be useful in program rules where the same data element is used in several program stages, and a rule needs to evaluate the newest data value from within one specific stage. |
    | **Data element from the newest event in the current program** | This source type is used when a program rule variable needs to reflect the newest known value of a data element, regardless of what event the user currently has open.<br>     <br>This source type is populated slightly differently in **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture** apps:<br>     <br>**Tracker Capture**: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value collected for the given data element within the enrollment.<br>     <br>**Event Capture**: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value found within the 10 newest events in the same organisation unit.<br>     <br>The newest data value is determined with event date. |
    | **Data element in current event** | Program rule variables with this source type will contain the data value from the same event that the user currently has open.<br>     <br>This is the most commonly used source type, especially for skip logic (hide actions) and warning/error rules. |
    | **Data element from previous event** | Program rule variables with this source type will contain the value from a specified data element from a previous event. Only older events is evaluated, not including the event that the user currently has open.<br>     <br>This source type is commonly used when a data element only should be collected once during an enrollment, and should be hidden in subsequent events.<br>     <br>Another use case is making rules for validating input where there is an expected progression from one event to the next - a rule can evaluate whether the previous value is higher/lower and give a warning if an unexpected value is entered.<br>     <br>This source type is populated slightly differently in **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture** apps:<br>     <br>**Tracker Capture**: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value collected for the given data element within the enrollment - but only evaluating the events that comes before the current event date.<br>     <br>**Event Capture**: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value collected within the 10 events preceding the current event date - not including the current event.<br>     <br>The newest data value is determined with event date. |
    | **Calculated value** | Program rule variable with this source type is not connected directly to any form data - but will be populated as a result of some other program rules **ASSIGN** action.<br>     <br>This variable will be used for making preliminary calculations, having a **ASSIGN** program rule action and assigning a value, this value can be used by other program rules - potentially making the expressions simpler and more maintanable.<br>     <br>These variables will not be persisted and will stay in memory only during the exectution of the set of program rules. Any program rule that assigns a data value to a preliminary calculated value would normally also have a **priority** assigned - to make sure that the preliminary caculation is done before the rule that consumes the calculated value. |
    | **Tracked entity attribute** | Populates the program rule variable with a specified tracked entity attribute for the current enrollment.<br>     <br>Use this is the source type to create program rules that evaluate data values entered during registration.<br>     <br>This source type is also useful when you create program rules that compare data in events to data entered during registration.<br>     <br>This source type is only used for tracker programs (programs with registration). |

6.  Click **Save**.

### Create or edit a program rule { #create_program_rule } 

> **Note**
>
> A program rule belongs to exactly one program.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program
    rule**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  Enter the program rule details. These fields are not shown to the
    end user, they are only meant for the program administrator.

      - **Program**

      - **Trigger rule only for program stage**

        If a program stage is selected, the program rule will only run for the selected program stage,
        as opposed to being run for every program stage in the program.

      - **Name**

      - **Description**

      - **Priority**

        Let's say you have 16 program rules in your program. You
        configure the program rules with the following priority
        settings:

          - Priority 1 for program rule A

          - Priority 2 for program rules B - K

          - No priority for program rules L - P

        Result: the system runs the program rules in the following
        order:

        1.  Program rule A

        2.  Program rules B - K (you can't find out or configure in
            which order the system runs these program rules)

        3.  Program rules L - P.

4.  Click **Enter program rule expression** and create the program rule
    expression with the help of variables, functions and operators.

5.  Click **Define program rule actions** and create the actions
    executed when the expression is true.

    1.  Click the add button, select an **Action** and enter the
        required information.

        Depending on the action type, you'll have to perform different
        types of settings. For some action types, you must also enter
        free text or create expressions.


        | Action type | Required settings | Description |
        |---|---|---|
        ||||
        | **Assign value** | **Data element to assign value to**<br>         <br>**Program rule variable to assign value to**<br>         <br>**Expression to evaluate and assign** | Used to help the user calculate and fill out fields in the data entry form. The idea is that the user shouldn’t have to fill in values that the system can calculate, for example BMI.<br>         <br>When a field is assigned a value, the user sees the value but the user can't edit it.<br>         <br>Example from Immunization stock card i Zambia: The data element for vaccine stock outgoing balance is calculated based on the data element for incoming stock balance minus the data elements for consumption and wastage.<br>         <br>Advanced use: configure an 'assign value' to do a part of a calculation and then assign the result of the calculation to a program rule variable. This is the purpose with the "Calculated value" program rule variable. |
        | **Display text** | **Display widget**<br>         <br>**Static text**<br>         <br>**Expression to evaluate and display after static text** | Used to display information that is not an error or a warning, for example feedback to the user. You can also use this action to display important information, for example the patient's allergies, to the user. |
        | **Display key/value pair** | **Display widget**<br>         <br>**Key label**<br>         <br>**Expression to evaluate and display as value** | Used to display information that is not an error or a warning.<br>         <br>Example: calculate number of weeks and days in a pregnancy and display it in the format the clinician is used to see it in. The calculation is based on previous recorded data. |
        | **Error on complete** | **Data element to display error next to**<br>         <br>**Tracked entity attribute to display error next to**<br>         <br>**Static text**<br>         <br>**Expression to evaluate and display after static text** | Used whenever you've cross-consistencies in the form that must be strictly adhered to. This action prevents the user from continuing until the error is resolved.<br>         <br>This action differs from the regular **Show error** since the error is not shown until the user tries to actually complete the form.<br>         <br>If you don't select a data element or a tracked entity attribute to display the error next to, make sure you write a comprehensive error message that helps the user to fix the error. |
        | **Hide field** | **Data element to hide**<br>         <br>**Tracked entity attribute to hide**<br>         <br>**Custom message for blanked field** | Used when you want to hide a field from the user.<br>         <br>**Custom message for blanked field** allows you to define a custom message displayed to the user in case the program rule hides and blanks out the field after the user typed in or selected a value.<br>         <br>If a hide field action hides a field that contains a value, the field will always removed. If no message is defined, a standard message will be displayed to alert the user. |
        | **Hide section** | **Program stage section to hide** | TBA |
        | **Hide program stage** | **Program stage to hide** | Used when you want to hide a program stage section from the user. |

The warning is shown in a dialog when the user completes the form.<br>         <br>**Static text** defines the message shown to the user when the expression is true and the action is triggered. This field is mandatory.<br>         <br>You can select which data element or tracked entity attribute to link the error to. This will help the user to fix the error.<br>         <br>If you don't select a data element or a tracked entity attribute to display the error next to, make sure you write a comprehensive error message that helps the user to fix the error. |

By using a program rule of type "Assign value" you can calculate the
"Gestational age at visit" value and fill it in the data entry form. You
configure the program rule to calculate "Gestational age at visit" based
on either "LMP date" or "Ultrasound estimated due
date".

## Configure relationship types { #configure_relationship_type } 

### About relationship types { #about_relationship_types } 

A relationship represents a link between two entities in the Tracker-model. A relationship is considered data in DHIS2 and is based on a Relationship Type, similar to how a Tracked Entity Instance is based on a Tracked Entity Type.

Relationships always include two entities, and these entities can include Tracked Entity Instances, Enrollments and Events, and any combination of these. Note that not all of these combinations are available in the current apps.

In addition, relationships can be defined as unidirectional or bidirectional. The only functional difference is currently that these requires different levels of access to create. Unidirectional relationships requires the user to have data write access to the “from” entity and data read access for the “to” entity, while bidirectional relationships require data write access for both sides.

For more information about configuration and the meaning of 'From constraint' and 'To constraint', see [Relationship model](relationship_model#relationship_model_relationship_type).

### Create or edit a relationship type { #create_relationship_type } 

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Relationship
    type**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  Type a **Name** of the relationship type.

4.  (Optional) Assign a **Code**.

5.  (Optional) Provide a **Description** of the relationship.

6. (Optional) Select whether the relationship should be bidirectional

7. Provide **Relationship name seen from inititating entity**. This is the name of the relationship that will be shown in the Data Entry app at the 'left' side of the relationship. E.g. in a Mother-child relationship this could be 'Mother of'.

8. (Optional) Provide **Relationship name seen from receiving entity**. This is the name of the relationship that will be shown at the 'right' side of the relationship in the Data Entry app. E.g. in a Mother-child relationship this could be 'Mother'.

9.  Select a 'From constraint'. This limits what kind of entities that can be included in the relationship. [Relationship model](relationship_model#relationship_model_relationship_type).

10. Select a 'To constraint'. This limits what kind of entities that can be included in the relationship. [Relationship model](relationship_model#relationship_model_relationship_type).

11. Click **Save**.

## Configure tracked entity types { #configure_tracked_entity } 

### About tracked entity types { #about_tracked_entity } 

A tracked entity is a types of entities which can be tracked through the
system. It can be anything from persons to commodities, for example a
medicine or a person.

A program must have one tracked entity. To enroll a tracked entity
instance into a program, the tracked entity type and tracked
entity type of a program must be the same.

Tracked entity attributes are used to register extra information for a
tracked entity. Tracked entity attributes can be shared between
programs.

### Create or edit a tracked entity attribute { #create_tracked_entity_attribute } 

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Tracked
    entity attribute**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  In the **Name** field, type the tracked entity attribute name.

4.  (Optional) Type a **Short name**.

4.  (Optional) Type a **Form name**.

5.  (Optional) In the **Code** field, assign a code.

6.  (Optional) Type a **Description**.

7. (Optional) In the **Field mask** field, you may type a template that's used to provide
   hints for correct formatting of the attribute. **NOTE: So far only implemented in the DHIS2 Android Capture app, not in the Capture and Tracker Capture web apps.**
   The following are special characters that can be used in the mask. The special characters match exactly one character of the given type.

   | Character     |    Match       |
   | ------------- |----------------|
   |      \\d      |     digit      |
   |      \\x      |lower case letter|
   |      \\X      | capital letter |
   |      \\w      |any alphanumeric character|

  For example, the pattern can be used to show hyphens as needed in the input field of the data element. E.g "\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d, would
  show an hyphen for every third digit.

8.  Select an **Option set**.

9.  In the **Value type** field, select the type of data that the
    tracked entity attribute will record.



    Table: Value types

    | Value type | Description |
    |---|---|

      - **Entire system**: The values of the tracked entity attribute
        can duplicate with values which belong to other tracked entity
        attributes. But the values in this tracked entity attribute must
        not duplicate.

        Select **Automatically generated** to allow automatic generation
        of the tracked entity attribute value. When the generate setting
        is selected on, an optional field for specifying pattern also
        displays. This field should contain a pattern based on the
        TextPattern syntax. When the value is automatically generated,
        it will be unique for this attribute for the entire system. See
        the TextPattern section for more information on how it works.

      - **Organisation unit**: The values of the tracked entity
        attribute must not duplicate in the same organisation unit.

## Configure search { #configure_search } 

Users can be given search organisation units, which makes it possible to
search for tracked entity instances outside their data capture
organisation units.

Searching can be done either in the context of a program, or in the
context of a tracked entity type. To be give users the option of
searching in the context of a program, it is necessary to configure
which of the programs tracked entity attributes is searchable. To give
users the option of searching in the context of a tracked entity type,
you will have to configure which of the tracked entity type attributes
is searchable.

### Configure search for tracker program

To be able to search with a program, you will have to make some of the
program attributes searchable. Unique program attributes will always be
searchable.

1.  Open **Program app**

2.  Open or create a tracker program

3.  Go to **Attributes**

4.  If you have no attributes, add one

5.  Set the attribute searchable

Searchable program attributes will assigned to a search group.

  - Unique group. One group per unique program attribute. Unique
    attributes cannot be combined with other program attributes in a
    search. The result from the search can only be 0 or 1 tracked entity
    instance.

  - Non-unique group. This group contains all non-unique program
    attributes and makes it possible to combine multiple attributes in a
    search.

There are two limits that can be set for a program search, as part of
the **Program** configuration.

  - Minimum number of attributes required to search: This property
    defines how many of the non-unique attributes that must be entered
    before a search can be performed.

<!-- end list -->

  - Maximum number of tracked entity instances to return: This property defines how specific a search must be, by limiting the number of matching tracked entity instances a user is allowed to get for her search criteria. If the number of matching records is larger than this maximum, they will not be returned. The user must provide more specific search criteria, in order to reduce the number of matching records, before they are returned.

    > **NOTE**
    >
    > This maximum is only applied to search results outside the users capture org unit. Within the capture scope, the user can see any number of results.

### Configure search for tracked entity type

> **Note**
>
> TET = Tracked entity type

To be able to search without a program, you will have to make some of
the TET attributes searchable. Unique TET attributes will always be
searchable.

1.  Open **Tracked entity type app**

2.  Open a Tracked entity type

3.  If the TET has no attributes, add one

4.  Set the attribute searchable

Searchable TET attributes will assigned to a search group.

  - Unique group. One group per unique TET attribute. Unique attributes
    cannot be combined with other TET attributes in a search. The result
    from the search can only be 0 or 1 tracked entity instance.

  - Non-unique group. This group contains all non-unique TET attributes
    and makes it possible to combine multiple attributes in a search.

There are two limits that can be set for a TET search

  - Minimum number of attributes required to search: This property
    defines how many of the non-unique attributes that must be entered
    before a search can be performed.

<!-- end list -->

  - Maximum number of tracked entity types to return: This property defines how specific a search must be, by limiting the number of matching tracked entity types a user is allowed to get for her search criteria. If the number of matching records is larger than this maximum, they will not be returned. The user must provide more specific search criteria, in order to reduce the number of matching records, before they are returned.

    > **NOTE**
    >
    > This maximum is only applied to search results outside the users capture org unit. Within the capture scope, the user can see any number of results.

### Configure search organisation units for a user

To be able to search in other organisation units than the users data
capture organisation units, the user must be assigned with search
organisation units. Giving a user a search organisation unit will also
give it access to search in all children of that organisation unit.

1.  Open **Users app**

2.  Click on a user

3.  Open **Assign search organisation units**

4.  Select organisation units

5.  Click **Save**

## Change sharing settings for metadata objects

You can assign different sharing settings to metadata objects, for
example organisation units and tracked entity attributes. These sharing
settings control which users and users groups that can view or edit a
metadata object.

Some metadata objects also allows you to change the sharing setting of
data entry for the object. These additional settings control who can
view or enter data in form fields using the metadata.

> **Note**
>
> The default setting is that everyone (**Public access**) can find,
> view and edit metadata objects.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and find the type of metadata object
    you want to modify.

2.  In the object list, click the context menu and select **Sharing
    settings**.

3.  (Optional) Add users or user groups: search for a user or a user
    group and select it. The user or user group is added to the list.

      - **Can edit and view**: The access group can view and edit the
        object.

      - **Can view only**: The access group can view the object.

      - **No access** (only applicable to **Public access**): The public
        won't have access to the object.

5.  Change data sharing settings for the access groups you want to
    modify.

      - **Can capture data**: The access group can view and capture data
        for the object.

      - **Can view data**: The access group can view data for the

## Translate metadata objects

DHIS2 provides functionality for translations of database content, for
example data elements, data element groups, indicators, indicator groups
or organisation units. You can translate these elements to any number of
locales. A locale represents a specific geographical, political, or
cultural region.

> **Appearance** and select a language.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and find the type of metadata object
    you want to translate.

2.  In the object list, click the options menu and select **Translate**.

    > **Tip**
    >
    > If you want to translate an organisation unit level, click
    > directly on the **Translate** icon next to each list item.

3.  Select a locale.

4.  Type a **Name**, **Short name** and **Description**.

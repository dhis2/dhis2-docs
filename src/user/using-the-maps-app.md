# Using the Maps app { #using_maps }

## About the Maps app { #about_maps }

The Maps App is introduced in release 2.29 and serves as a replacement
of the GIS App offering a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
The mapping engine from version 2.34 is based on WebGL technology,
capable of showing thousands of features on a map simultaneously.

With the Maps app you can overlay multiple layers and choose among
different base maps. You can create thematic maps of areas and points,
view facilities based on classifications, and visualize catchment areas
for each facility. You can add labels to areas and points, and search
and filter using various criteria. You can move points and set locations
on the fly. Maps can be saved as favorites and shared with other users
and groups, or downloaded as an image.

> **Note**
>
> To use predefined legends in the **Maps** app, you need to create them
> first in the **Maintenance** app.

- The **layer panel** on the left side of the workspace shows an
  overview of the layers for the current map:

  - As layers are added, using the **(+) Add layer** button, they
    are arranged and managed in this panel.

  - The **basemap** is always shown in the panel. The default
    basemap is OSM Light and is selected by default. OpenStreetMap
    Detailed contains more map features and place names. There are 4
    basemaps from Bing Maps, replacing Google Maps provided in previous
    versions. Bing Road and Bing Dark shows roads, borders and places.
    Use the dark version if the colors on your map layers are bright.
    Bing Aerial and Bing Aerial Labels shos satellite and detailed aerial
    imagery. Switch between them by selecting the desired image.

  - The small arrow button to the right of the layer panel, at the
    top, allows the panel to be hidden or shown.

    _Labels overlay_ is an [external
    layer](#using_maps_external_map_layers) defined in the Maintenance app.

## Manage thematic layers { #using_maps_thematic_layer }

_Thematic maps_ represent spatial variation of geographic distributions.
Select your desired combination of indicator/data element, period and
organisation unit level. If your database has coordinates and aggregated
data values for these organisation units, they will appear on the map.

> **Note**
>
> You must generate the DHIS2 analytics tables to have aggregated data
> values available.

![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_mapping.png)

Thematic layers are represented by layer _cards_ in the layer panel such
as:

Along the top of the thematic card from left to right are:

- A grab field to allow dragging and re-ordering layers with the mouse

- The title and period associated with the layer

- An arrow symbol to collapse and expand the thematic card

In the middle of the thematic card is a legend indicating the value
ranges displayed on the layer.

Along the bottom of the thematic card from left to right are:

- An edit (pencil) button to open the layer configuration dialog

- An eye symbol for toggling the visibility of the layer

- A slider for modifying the layer transparency

- A more actions (three dots) button with additional options:

    associated with the layer

  - **Download data** allows you to download the data for this layer in GeoJSON format for use in other mapping software

  - **Edit layer** is the same as edit button above

  - **Remove layer** will remove this layer from the current map.

### Create a thematic layer

To create an event layer, choose **Thematic** on the **Add
layer** selection. This opens the Events layer configuration dialog.

1.  In the **DATA** tab:

    ![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_layer_dialog_DATA.png)

    - Select a data type and then select respectively the group and
      the target element. The available fields depend on the type of
      item selected.

    - Select a value from the **Aggregation type** field for the data
      values to be shown on the map. By default, "By data element" is
      selected. Alternative values are: Count; Average; Sum; Standard
      deviation; Variance; Min; Max. See also [Aggregation
      operators](https://dhis2.github.io/dhis2-docs/master/en/user/html/ch10s05.html#d0e8082).

2.  In the **PERIOD** tab

    ![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_layer_dialog_PERIOD.png)

    - select the time span over which the thematic data is mapped.
      You can select either a relative or a fixed period.

      - Relative period

        In the **Period type** field select **Relative**, then
        select one of the relative periods, for example **Last year** or
        **Last 12 months**, in the **Period** field.

        A **default relative period for analysis** can be set in the **Systems Settings**
        app.

        If you select a relative period covering multiple years/months/weeks/days
        the layer can be displayed as

        - Single (aggregate)

          Show aggregate values for the relative period selected (default).

        - Timeline

          Includes a timeline allowing you to step through the periods.
          Only one timeline layer can be added to the same map.

        - Split map views

          Show multiple maps allowing you to compare different periods
          side by side. Supported for relative periods with 12 items
          or below. Can not be combined with other layer types.

      - Fixed period

        In the **Period type** field select period length, then
        select the target in the **Period** field.

      - Start/end dates

        In the **Period type** field select **Start/end dates**
        and fill in a start date and an end date.

3.  In the **ORG UNITS** tab:

    ![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_layer_dialog_ORG_UNITS.png)

    - Select the organisation units you want to include in the layer.
      It is possible to select either

      - One or more specific organisation units, organisation unit levels in
        the hierarchy, organisation unit groups, or

      - A relative level in the organisation unit hierarchy, with
        respect to the user. By selecting a **User organisation
        unit** the map data will appear differently for users at
        different levels in the organisation unit hierarchy.

4.  In the **FILTER** tab:

    ![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_layer_dialog_FILTER.png)

    - Click ADD FILTER and select an available data item to add a new
      filter to the data set.

      - Select a data dimension from the drop down box. You can
        reduce the number of dimensions shown by using the search field.
        Click on the name to select a dimension.

      - When a dimension is selected you get a second drop down with
        dimension items. Check the items you want to include in the
        filter.

      Multiple filters may be added. Click the trash button on the right of
      the filter to remove it.

5.  In the **STYLE** tab:

    ![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_layer_dialog_STYLE.png)

    - Select either **Choropleth** or **Bubble maps**.

      - Choropleth will assign a color to each org unit shape according to the
        data value. This is the recommended technique if the data is normalised
        (per capita).

      - Bubble map will show data values as proportional circles. Use this
        technique if the data is not normalised (absolute numbers). The circles are
        placed in the center of each org unit.

    - Set the **Low radius** and **High radius** for the proportional circles or the
      point facilities. The circles will be scaled between low and high radius according
      to the data value. The radius needs to be between 0 and 50 px.

    - **Show labels**: Allows org unit names to be shown on the layer. Font size, weight,
      style and color can be modified here.

    - **Show no data**: By default org units with missing data values will not show on the map.
      Check this box if you want to show them with a color. Click the color to change it.

    - Select the legend type:

      - **Automatic color legend**: the application will create a legend for you based on
        what classification method, number of classes and the color scale you select. Set
        **Classification** to either:

        - Equal intervals

          the range of each interval will be (highest data value - lowest data value / number of classes)

        - Equal counts

          the legend creator will try to distribute the organisation units evenly.

      - **Predefined color legend**: Select between the predefined legends.

      - **Single color legend**: Select the color of the bubbles or circles. Only available
        for bubble maps.

6.  Click **ADD LAYER**.

### Modify a thematic layer

1.  In the layer panel, click the edit (pencil) icon on the thematic
    layer card.

2.  Modify the setting on any of the tabs as desired.

3.  Click **UPDATE LAYER**.

### Open organisation unit profile

You can open the [organisation unit profile](#using_maps_org_unit_profile) in two ways:

1. Click on any of the organisasjon units shown on the map, and click
   the **View profile** button in the popup.

2. Right-click one of the organisation units, and select **View profile** from
   the menu.

### Filter values in a thematic layer

Thematic layers have a **data table** option that can be toggled on or
off from the thematic layer card.

![](resources/images/maps/maps_thematic_layer_data_table.png)

The data table displays the data forming the thematic layer.

- clicking on a title will sort the table based on that column;
  toggling between ascending and descending.

- entering text or expressions into the filter fields below the titles
  will apply those filters to the data, and the display will adjust
  according to the filter. The filters are applied as follows:

  - NAME

    filter by name containing the given text

  - VALUE

    filter values by given numbers and/or ranges, for example:
    2,\>3&\<8

  - LEGEND

    filter by legend containing the given text

  - RANGE

    filter by ranges containing the given text

  - LEVEL

    filter level by numbers and/or ranges, for example: 2,\>3&\<8

  - PARENT

    filter by parent names containing the given text

  - ID

    filter by IDs containing the given text

  - TYPE

    filter by GIS display types containing the given text

  - COLOR

    filter by color names containing the given text

> **Note**
>
> Data table filters are temporary and are not saved with the map layers
> as part of the favourite.

### Search for an organisation unit

The NAME filter field in the data table provides an effective way of
searching for individual organisation units.

### Navigate between organisation hierarchies

When there are visible organisation units on the map, you can easily
navigate up and down in the hierarchy without using the level/parent
user interface.

1.  Right-click one of the organisation units.

2.  Select **Drill up one level** or **Drill down one level**.

    The drill down option is disabled if you are on the lowest level or
    if there are no coordinates available on the level below. Likewise
    the drill up option is disabled from the highest level.

### Remove thematic layer

To clear all data in a thematic layer:

1.  In the layer card to the left, click the _more actions_ (three dots) icon
    and then on **Remove layer**.

    The layer is removed from the current map.

## Manage event layers { #using_maps_event_layer }

The event layer displays the geographical location of events registered
in the DHIS2 tracker. Provided that events have associated point or polygon
coordinates, you can use this layer to drill down from the aggregated
data displayed in the thematic layers to the underlying individual
events or cases.

You can also display aggregated events for facilities or organisation
units. You do this through a thematic layer using event data
items. This is useful when you only have the coordinates for the Org
Unit under which the events are recorded.

![](resources/images/maps/maps_event_layer.png)

Event layers are represented by layer _cards_ in the layer panel such
as:

Along the top of the event card from left to right are:

- A grab field to allow dragging and re-ordering layers with the mouse

- The title and period associated with the layer

- An arrow symbol to collapse and expand the event card

In the middle of the event card is a legend indicating the styling of
the layer.

Along the bottom of the event card from left to right are:

- An edit (pencil) button to open the layer configuration dialog

- An eye symbol for toggling the visibility of the layer

- A slider for modifying the layer transparency

- A more actions (three dots) button with additional options:

      field is only shown once a program is selected.

      If there is only one stage available for the selected program,
      the stage is automatically selected.

    - Select a value from the **Coordinate field** for the positions
      shown on the map. By default, "Event location" is selected.
      Depending on the data elements or attributes that belong to a
      program, other coordinates such as "Household position" are
      available.

    - By default all events with coordinates are shown on the map.
      Use the **Event status** field to only show events having one
      status: Active, Completed, Schedule, Overdue or Skipped.

2.  In the **PERIOD** tab

    ![](resources/images/maps/maps_event_layer_dialog_PERIOD.png)

        arrow or by start typing directly in the box to filter for
        options.

      - For data item of type _number_, you can select operators like
        equal, not equal, greater than or less than.

      - For data item of type _boolean_ (yes/no), you can check the box
        if the condition should be valid or true.

      - For data item of type _text_ you will get two choices:
        **Contains** implies that the query will match all values
        which contains your search value, and **Is exact** implies
        that only values which is completely identical to your
        search query will be returned.

      Multiple filters may be added. Click the trash button on the right of
      the filter to remove it.

5.  In the **STYLE** tab:

    - Select a **color** for the event or cluster points.

    - Select the **radius** (between 1 and 20) for the events.

    - Select **Show buffer** to display visual buffer around each
      event. The radius of the buffer can be modified here. This
      option is only available if you select **View all events**
      above.

    - Select a **Style by data element** to colorise the events
      according to a data value. If you also select to group events,
      the culsters will be displayed as small donut charts showing
      the distribution of the data values. The options varies for
      different data types:

![](resources/images/maps/maps_event_layer_data_table.png)

The data table displays the data forming the event layer.

- clicking on a title will sort the table based on that column;
  toggling between ascending and descending.

- entering text or expressions into the filter fields below the titles
  will apply those filters to the data, and the display will adjust
  according to the filter. The filters are applied as follows:

  - ID

    filter by event IDs containing the given text

  - ORG UNIT

    filter by org unit name containing the given text

  - EVENT TIME

    filter by event time containing the given text

  - TYPE

    filter by GIS display types containing the given text

  - **Style by data element**: If events are styled by a data element
    (e.g. gender) both the data value and the color can be filtered.

  - **Display in reports**: Data elements checked to display in reports will
    be shown in separate columns (see below how to add them).

  - Numeric data values can be filtered by given numbers, and/or ranges,
    for example: 2,\>3&\<8

> **Note**
>
> Data table filters are temporary and are not saved with the map layers

### Download raw event layer data

The raw data for event layers can be downloaded in GeoJSON format for more advanced geo-analytics and processing in desktop GIS software such as [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/). The downloaded data includes all individual events as GeoJSON features, including attributes for each data element selected for **Display in reports**.

![](resources/images/maps/maps_data_download_dialog.png)

- In the layer card to the left, click the _more actions_ (three dots) icon and then on **Download data**

- Select the **ID format** to use as the key for Data Element values in the downloaded GeoJSON file. There are three options available:

  - **ID** - Use the unique ID of the data element
  - **Name** - Use the human-friendly name of the data element (translated)
  - **Code** - Use the code of the data element

- Select whether or not to **Use human-readable keys** for other Event attributes, such as Program Stage, Latitude, Longitude, Event Data, and Organization Unit ID, Name, and Code. When this option is **not** selected these values will be the computer-friendly ID instead of the human-readable (and translated) name.

- Click the **DOWNLOAD** button to generate and download a GeoJSON file. The data will be requested from the DHIS2 server and processed by the maps application. This operation may take several minutes to complete.

- Once the GeoJSON file has been downloaded it can be imported into most standard GIS software applications.

> Note that the downloaded data does not include style information as it is not natively supported by the GeoJSON format. Styles can optionally be recreated in external GIS applications using the attributes of each feature.

### Clear event layer

To clear all event layer data in a map:

1.  In the layer card to the left, click the _more actions_ (three dots) icon
    and then on **Remove layer**.

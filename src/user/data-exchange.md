# Using the Data Exchange app { #data_exchange }

## About the Data Exchange app { #about_data_exchange }

The data exchange app allows for exchanging data between the DHIS 2 instance where the app is installed and a target instance of DHIS 2, or other software that are capable of importing the DHIS 2 data value set format. Data can also be exchanged within a DHIS 2 instance, for instance for aggregation of tracker data and saving the result as aggregate data.

To exchange data, one or many _aggregate data exchanges_ must be configured in the system. A data exchange defines the data elements, indicators, periods and organisation units to exchange data with the target instance. Please consult the _Aggregate data exchange_ section in the _Data exchange_ chapter in the Developer guide for a detailed explanation.

The submission summary indicates the outcome, meaning whether the operation was a success or failure, and how many data values were imported, updated and ignored as part of the data exchange.

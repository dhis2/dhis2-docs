# New Tracker

Version 2.36 of DHIS2 introduced a set of new tracker endpoints dedicated to importing and querying tracker objects (Including tracked entities, enrollments, events, and relationships).
These new endpoints set a discontinuity with earlier implementations. Re-engineering the endpoints allowed developers to improve, redesign, and formalize the API's behavior to improve the Tracker services.

The newly introduced endpoints consist of:

* `POST /api/tracker`
* `GET /api/tracker/enrollments`
* `GET /api/tracker/events`
* `GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities`
* `GET /api/tracker/relationships`

> **NOTE**
>
> - The old endpoints are marked as deprecated but still work as before.
> - Some functionality is not yet ready in the new endpoints, but they support their primary use-cases.
> - These endpoints currently only support the `JSON` format as input/output.
> - Support for the `CSV` format will also be available in the future.

## Changes in the API

Property names used in the API have changed to use consistent naming across all the new endpoints.

### Tracker Import changelog (`POST`)

The following table highlights the differences between the previous tracker import endpoints (/api/trackedEntityInstance, /api/enrollments, /api/events and /api/relatiosnhips) and the new endpoint (/api/tracker). All endpoints are still currently available.

## Tracker Objects { #webapi_nti_tracker_objects }

Tracker consists of a few different types of objects that are nested together to represent the data. In this section, we will show and describe each of the objects used in the Tracker API.

### Tracked Entity

`Tracked Entities` are the root object for the Tracker model.

| Property | Description | Required | Updateable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| trackedEntity | The identifier of the tracked entity. Generated if not supplied | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| trackedEntityType | The type of tracked entity. | Yes | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the user created the tracked entity. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| createdAtClient | Timestamp when the user created the tracked entity on the client. | No | No | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the object was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAtClient | Timestamp when the object was last updated on the client. | No | No | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| orgUnit | The organisation unit where the user created the tracked entity. | Yes | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| inactive | Indicates whether the tracked entity is inactive or not. | No | No | Boolean | Default: False, True |
| deleted | Indicates whether the tracked entity has been deleted. It can only change when deleting. | No | Yes | Boolean | False until deleted |
| geometry | A  geographical representation of the tracked entity. Based on the "featureType" of the TrackedEntityType. | No | No | GeoJson | {<br>"type": "POINT",<br>"coordinates": [123.0, 123.0]<br>} |
| storedBy | Client reference for who stored/created the tracked entity. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |
| attributes | A list of tracked entity attribute values owned by the tracked entity. | No | No | List of TrackedEntityAttributeValue | See Attribute |
| enrollments | A list of enrollments owned by the tracked entity. | No | No | List of Enrollment | See Enrollment |
| relationships | A list of relationships connected to the tracked entity. | No | No | List of Relationship | See Relationship |
| programOwners | A list of organisation units that have access through specific programs to this tracked entity. See "Program Ownership" for more. | No | No | List of ProgramOwner | See section "Program Ownership" |

> **Note**
>
> `Tracked Entities` "owns" all `Tracked Entity Attribute Values` (Or "attributes" as described in the previous table). However, `Tracked Entity Attributes` are either connected to a `Tracked Entity` through its `Tracked Entity Type` or a `Program`. We often refer to this separation as `Tracked Entity Type Attrbiutes` and `Tracked Entity Program Attributes`. The importance of this separation is related to access control and limiting what information the user can see.
>
> The "attributes" referred to in the `Tracked Entity` are `Tracked Entity Type Attributes`.


### Enrollment
`Tracked Entities` can enroll into `Programs` for which they are eligible. Tracked entities are eligible as long as the program is configured with the same `Tracked Entity Type` as the tracked entity. We represent the enrollment with the `Enrollment` object, which we describe in this section.


| Property | Description | Required | Immutable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| enrollment | The identifier of the enrollment. Generated if not supplied | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| program | The program the enrollment represents. | Yes | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| trackedEntity | A reference to the tracked entity enrolled. | Yes | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| trackedEntityType | Only for reading data. The type of tracked entity enrolled | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| status | Status of the enrollment. ACTIVE if not supplied. | No | No | Enum | ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED |
| orgUnit | The organisation unit where the user enrolled the tracked entity. | Yes | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| orgUnitName | Only for reading data. The name of the organisation unit where the enrollment took place. | No | No | String:Any | Sierra Leone |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the user created the object. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| createdAtClient | Timestamp when the user created the object on client | No | No | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the object was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAtClient | Timestamp when the object was last updated on client | No | No | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| enrolledAt | Timestamp when the user enrolled the tracked entity. | Yes | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| occurredAt | Timestamp when enrollment occurred. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| completedAt | Timestamp when the user completed the enrollment. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| completedBy | Reference to who completed the enrollment | No | No | John Doe |
| followUp | Indicates whether the enrollment requires follow-up. False if not supplied | No | No | Booelan | Default: False, True |
| deleted | Indicates whether the enrollment has been deleted. It can only change when deleting. | No | Yes | Boolean | False until deleted |
| geometry | A  geographical representation of the enrollment. Based on the "featureType" of the Program | No | No | GeoJson | {<br>"type": "POINT",<br>"coordinates": [123.0, 123.0]<br>} |
| storedBy | Client reference for who stored/created the enrollment. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |
| attributes | A list of tracked entity attribute values connected to the enrollment. | No | No | List of TrackedEntityAttributeValue | See Attribute |
| events | A list of events owned by the enrollment. | No | No | List of Event | See Event |
| relationships | A list of relationships connected to the enrollment. | No | No | List of Relationship | See Relationship |
| notes | Notes connected to the enrollment. It can only be created. | No | Yes | List of Note | See Note |

> **Note**
>
> `Tracked Entities` "owns" all `Tracked Entity Attribute Values` (Or "attributes" as described in the previous table). However, `Tracked Entity Attributes` are either connected to a `Tracked Entity` through its `Tracked Entity Type` or a `Program`. We often refer to this separation as `Tracked Entity Type Attrbiutes` and `Tracked Entity Program Attributes`. The importance of this separation is related to access control and limiting what information the user can see.
>
> The "attributes" referred to in the `Enrollment` are `Tracked Entity Program Attributes`.


### Events
`Events` are either part of an `EVENT PROGRAM` or `TRACKER PROGRAM`. For `TRACKER PROGRAM`, events belong to an `Enrollment`, which again belongs to a `Tracked Entity`. On the other hand, `EVENT PROGRAM` is `Events` not connected to a specific `Enrollment` or `Tracked Entity`. The difference is related to whether we track a specific `Tracked Entity` or not. We sometimes refer to `EVENT PROGRAM` events as "anonymous events" or "single events" since they only represent themselves and not another `Tracked Entity`.

In the API, the significant difference is that all events are either connected to the same enrollment (`EVENT PROGRAM`) or different enrollments (`TRACKER PROGRAM`). The table below will point out any exceptional cases between these two.

| Property | Description | Required | Immutable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| event | The identifier of the event. Generated if not supplied | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| programStage | The program stage the event represents. | Yes | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| enrollment | A reference to the enrollment which owns the event. | Yes | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| program | Only for reading data. The type of program the enrollment which owns the event has. | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| trackedEntity | Only for reading data. The tracked entity which owns the event. ***Not applicable for `EVENT PROGRAM`*** | No | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| status | Status of the event. ACTIVE if not supplied. | No | No | Enum | ACTIVE, COMPLETED, VISITED, SCHEDULE, OVERDUE, SKIPPED |
| enrollmentStatus | Only for reading data. The status of the enrollment which owns the event. ***Not applicable for `EVENT PROGRAM`*** | No | No | Enum | ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED |
| orgUnit | The organisation unit where the user registered the event. | Yes | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| orgUnitName | Only for reading data. The name of the organisation unit where the user registered the event. | No | No | String:Any | Sierra Leone |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the user created the event. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| createdAtClient | Timestamp when the user created the event on client | No | No | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the event was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAtClient | Timestamp when the event was last updated on client | No | No | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| scheduledAt | Timestamp when the event was scheduled for. | Yes | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| occurredAt | Timestamp when something occurred. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| completedAt | Timestamp when the user completed the event. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| completedBy | Reference to who completed the event | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |
| followUp | Indicates whether the event has been flagged for follow-up. False if not supplied | No | No | Booelan | Default: False, True |
| deleted | Indicates whether the event has been deleted. It can only change when deleting. | No | Yes | Boolean | False until deleted |
| geometry | A  geographical representation of the event. Based on the "featureType" of the Program Stage | No | No | GeoJson | {<br>"type": "POINT",<br>"coordinates": [123.0, 123.0]<br>} |
| storedBy | Client reference for who stored/created the event. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |
| attributeOptionCombo | Attribute option combo for the event. Default if not supplied or configured. | No | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345
| attributeCategoryOptions | Attribute category option for the event. Default if not supplied or configured. | No | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345
| assignedUser | A reference to a user who has been assigned to the event. | No | No | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| dataValues | A list of data values connected to the event. | No | No | List of TrackedEntityAttributeValue | See Attribute |
| relationships | A list of relationships connected to the event. | No | No | List of Relationship | See Relationship |
| notes | Notes connected to the event. It can only be created. | No | Yes | List of Note | See Note |

### Relationship

`Relationships` are objects that link together two other tracker objects. The constraints each side of the relationship must conform to are based on the `Relationship Type` of the `Relationship`.


| Property | Description | Required | Immutable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| relationship | The identifier of the relationship. Generated if not supplied. | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| relationshipType | The type of the relationship. Decides what objects can be linked in a relationship. | Yes | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| relationshipName | Only for reading data. The name of the relationship type of this relationship | No | No | String:Any | Sibling |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the user created the relationship. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the relationship was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| bidirectional | Only for reading data. Indicated whether the relationship type is bidirectional or not. | No | No | Boolean | True or False |
| from, to | A reference to each side of the relationship. Must conform to the constraints set in the relationship type | Yes | Yes | RelationshipItem | {"trackedEntity": "ABCEF12345"}, {"enrollment": "ABCDEF12345"} or {"event": "ABCDEF12345"} |

> **Note**
>
>`Relationship item` represents a link to an object. Since a `relationship` can be between any tracker object like `tracked entity`, `enrollment`, and `event`, the value depends on the `relationship type`. For example, if the `relationship type` connects from an `event` to a `tracked entity`, the format is strict:
>```json
>{
>   "from": {
>     "event": "ABCDEF12345"    
>   },
>   "to": {
>     "trackedEntity": "FEDCBA12345"
>   }
>}
>```

### Attribute
`Attributes` are the actual values describing the `tracked entities`. They can either be connected through a `tracked entity type` or a `program`. Implicitly this means `attributes` can be part of both a `tracked entity` and an `enrollment`.

| Property | Description | Required | Immutable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| attribute | A reference to the tracked entity attribute represented. | Yes | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| code | Only for reading data. The code of the tracked entity attribute. | No | No | String:Any | ABC |
| displayName | Only for reading data. The displayName of the tracked entity attribute. | No | No | String:Any | Name |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the value was added. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the value was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| storedBy | Client reference for who stored/created the value. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |
| valueType | Only for reading data. The type of value the attribute represents. | No | No | Enum | TEXT, INTEGER, and more |
| value | The value of the tracked entity attribute. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |

> **Note**
>
> For `attributes` only the "attribute" and "value" properties are required when adding data. "value" can be null, which implies the user should remove the value.
>
> In the context of tracker objects, we refer to `Tracked Entity Attributes` and `Tracked Entity Attribute Values` as "attributes". However, attributes are also their own thing, related to metadata. Therefore it's vital to separate Tracker attributes and metadata attributes. In the tracker API, it is possible to reference the metadata attributes when specifying `idScheme` (See request parameters for more information).

### Data Values
While `Attributes` describes a `tracked entity` or an `enrollment`, `data values` describes an `event`. The major difference is that `attributes` can only have a single value for a given `tracked entity`. In contrast, `data values` can have many different values across different `events` - even if the `events` all belong to the same `enrollment` or `tracked entity`.

| Property | Description | Required | Immutable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dataElement | The data element this value represents. | Yes | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| value | The value of the data value. | No | No | String:Any | 123 |
| providedElsewhere | Indicates whether the user provided the value elsewhere or not. False if not supplied. | No | No | Boolean | False or True |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the user added the value. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the value was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| storedBy | Client reference for who stored/created the value. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |


> **Note**
>
> For `data elements` only the "dataElement" and "value" properties are required when adding data. "value" can be null, which implies the user should remove the value.

### Tracker Notes

DHIS2 tracker allows for capturing of data using data elements and tracked entity attributes. However, sometimes there could be a situation where it is necessary to record additional information or comment about the issue at hand. Such additional information can be captured using tracker notes. Tracker notes are equivalent to data value comments from the Aggregate DHIS2 side.

There are two types of tracker notes - notes recorded at the event level and those recorded at the enrollment level. An enrollment can have one or more events. Comments about each of the events - for example, why an event was missed, rescheduled, or why only a few data elements were filled and the like - can be documented using event notes. Each of the events within an enrollment can have its own story/notes. One can then record, for example, an overall observation of these events using the parent enrollment note. Enrollment notes are also helpful to document, for example, why an enrollment is canceled. It is the user's imagination and use-case when and how to use notes.

Both enrollment and event can have as many notes as needed - there is no limit. However, it is not possible to delete or update neither of these notes. They are like a logbook. If one wants to amend a note, one can do so by creating another note. The only way to delete a note is by deleting the parent object - either event or enrollment. 

Tracker notes do not have their dedicated endpoint; they are exchanged as part of the parent event and/or enrollment payload. Below is a sample payload.

```json
{
  "trackedEntityInstance": "oi3PMIGYJH8",
  <entity_details>,
  ],
  "enrollments": [
    {
      "enrollment": "EbRsJr8LSSO",
      <enrollment_details>
      "notes": [
        {
          "note": "vxmCvYcPdaW",
          "value": "Enrollment note 2.",
        },
        {
          "value": "Enrollment note 1",
        }
      ],
      
      "events": [
        {
          "event": "zfzS9WeO0uM",
          <event_details>,
          "notes": [
            {
              "note": "MAQFb7fAggS",
              "value": "Event Note 1.",
            },
            {
              "value": "Event Note 2.",
            }
          ],
        },
        {
          ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


| Property | Description | Required | Immutable | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| note | The reference of the note. Generated if empty | No | Yes | String:Uid | ABCDEF12345 |
| value | The content of the note. | Yes | Yes | String:Any | This is a note |
| storedAt | Timestamp when the user added the note. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the note was last updated. Set on the server. | No | Yes | Date:ISO 8601 | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| storedBy | Client reference for who stored/created the note. | No | No | String:Any | John Doe |

## Tracker Import (`POST /api/tracker`) { #webapi_nti_import }

The `POST /api/tracker` endpoint allows clients to import the following tracker objects into DHIS2:

* **Tracked entities**
* **Enrollments**
* **Events**
* **Relationships**
* Data embedded in other [tracker objects](#webapi_nti_tracker_objects)

Main changes compared to the other endpoints for tracker import are:

1. Import payload can be ***nested*** or ***flat***
2. Invocation can be ***synchronous*** or ***asynchronous***

### Request parameters

Currently, the tracker import endpoint supports the following parameters:

| Parameter name | Description | Type | Allowed values |
|---|---|---|---|
| async | Indicates whether the import should happen asynchronously or synchronously. | Boolean | `TRUE`, `FALSE` |
| reportMode | Only when performing synchronous import. See importSummary for more info. | Enum | `FULL`, `ERRORS`, `WARNINGS` |
| importMode | Indicates the mode of import. Can either be validation only or commit (Default) | Enum | `VALIDATION`, `COMMIT` |
| idScheme | Indicates the overall idScheme to use when importing. Default is AUTO (UID). Can be overridden for specific metadata (Listed below) | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| dataElementIdScheme | Indicates the idScheme to use for data elements when importing. | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| orgUnitIdScheme | Indicates the idScheme to use for organisation units when importing. | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| programIdScheme | Indicates the idScheme to use for programs when importing. | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| programStageIdScheme | Indicates the idScheme to use for program stages when importing. | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| categoryOptionComboIdScheme | Indicates the idScheme to use for category option combos when importing. | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| categoryOptionIdScheme | Indicates the idScheme to use for category options when importing. | Enum | `UID`, `CODE`, `NAME`, `ATTRIBUTE`, `AUTO` |
| importStrategy | Indicates the effect the import should have. Can either be `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE_AND_UPDATE` and `DELETE`, which respectively only allows importing new data, importing changes to existing data, importing any new or updates to existing data, and finally deleting data. | Enum | `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE_AND_UPDATE`, `DELETE` |
| atomicMode | Indicates how the import responds to validation errors. If `ALL`, all data imported must be valid for any data to be committed. For `OBJECT`, only the data committed needs to be valid, while other data can be invalid. | Enum | `ALL`, `OBJECT` |
| flushMode | Indicates the frequency of flushing. This is related to how often data is pushed into the database during the import. Primarily used for debugging reasons, and should not be changed in a production setting | Enum | `AUTO`, `OBJECT` |
| validationMode | Indicates the completeness of the validation step. It can be skipped, set to fail fast (Return on the first error), or full(Default), which will return any errors found | Enum | `FULL`, `FAIL_FAST`, `SKIP` |
| skipPatternValidation | If true, it will skip validating the pattern of generated attributes. | Boolean | `TRUE`, `FALSE` |
| skipSideEffects | If true, it will skip running any side effects for the import | Boolean | `TRUE`, `FALSE` |
| skipRuleEngine | If true, it will skip running any program rules for the import | Boolean | `TRUE`, `FALSE` |

### Flat and nested payloads

The importer support both flat and nested payloads. The main difference is how the client requires their data to be structured.

**Flat**
:   The flat-structured payload is straightforward. It can contain collections for each of the core tracker objects we have. This works seamlessly with existing data, which already have UIDs assigned. However, for new data, the client will have to provide new UIDs for any references between objects. For example, if you import a new tracked entity with a new enrollment, the tracked entity requires the client to provide a UID so that the enrollment can be linked to that UID.

**Nested**
:   Nested payloads are the most commonly used structure. Here, tracker objects are embedded within their parent object; For example, an enrollment within a tracked entity. The advantage of this structure is that the client does not need to provide UIDs for these connections since they will be given this connection during the import process since they are nested together.

> **NOTE**
>
> While nested payloads might prove simpler for clients to deal with, the payload will always be flattened before the import. This means that for large imports, providing a flat structured payload will provide both more control and lower overhead for the import process itself.

Examples for the **FLAT** and the **NESTED** versions of the payload are listed below. Both cases use the same data.

#### ***FLAT*** payload

### SYNC and ASYNC
For the user, the main difference between importing synchronously rather than asynchronously is the immediate response from the API. For the synchronous import, the response will be returned as soon as the import finishes with the importSummary. However, for asynchronous imports, the response will be immediate and contain a reference where the client can poll for updates to the import.

For significant imports, it might be beneficial for the client to use the asynchronous import to avoid waiting too long for a response.


Examples of the **ASYNC** response is shown below. For **SYNC** response, look at the [importSummary section](#webapi_nti_import_summary).

```json
{
    "httpStatus": "OK",
    "httpStatusCode": 200,
    "status": "OK",
    "message": "Tracker job added",
    "response": {
        "responseType": "TrackerJob",
        "id": "LkXBUdIgbe3",
        "location": "https://play.dhis2.org/dev/api/tracker/jobs/LkXBUdIgbe3"
    }
}
```

### Import Summary { #webapi_nti_import_summary }

The Tracker API has two primary endpoints for consumers to acquire feedback from their imports. These endpoints are most relevant for async import jobs but are available for sync jobs as well. These endpoints will return either the log related to the import or the import summary itself.

> **Note**
>
> These endpoints rely on information stored in the application memory. This means the information will be unavailable after certain cases, as an application restart or after a large number of import requests have started after this one.

After submitting a tracker import request, we can access the following endpoints in order to monitor the job progress based on logs:

`GET /tracker/jobs/{uid}`

| Parameter|Description|Example
|---|---|---|
|`{uid}`| The UID of an existing tracker import job | ABCDEF12345

#### ***REQUEST*** example

`GET /tracker/jobs/mEfEaFSCKCC`

#### ***RESPONSE*** example

```json
[
  {
    "uid": "mEfEaFSCKCC",
    "level": "INFO",
    "category": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB",
    "time": "2021-01-01T00:00:06.00",
    "message": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB ( mEfEaFSCKCC ) finished in 6.00000 sec. Import:Done",
    "completed": true,
    "id": "mEfEaFSCKCC"
  },

    "uid": "mEfEaFSCKCC",
    "level": "DEBUG",
    "category": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB",
    "time": "2021-01-01T00:00:05.00",

  {
    "uid": "mEfEaFSCKCC",
    "level": "DEBUG",

    "time": "2021-01-01T00:00:03.00",
    "message": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB ( mEfEaFSCKCC ) programrule completed in 1.00000 sec. Import:programrule",
    "completed": true,
    "id": "mEfEaFSCKCC"
  },
  {
    "uid": "mEfEaFSCKCC",
    "level": "DEBUG",
    "category": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB",
    "time": "2021-01-01T00:00:02.00",
    "message": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB ( mEfEaFSCKCC ) validation completed in 1.00000 sec. Import:validation",
    "completed": true,
    "id": "mEfEaFSCKCC"
  },
  {
    "uid": "mEfEaFSCKCC",
    "level": "DEBUG",
    "category": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB",
    "time": "2021-01-01T00:00:01.00",
    "message": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB ( mEfEaFSCKCC ) preheat completed in 1.00000 sec. Import:preheat",
    "completed": true,
    "id": "mEfEaFSCKCC"
  },
  {
    "uid": "mEfEaFSCKCC",
    "level": "INFO",
    "category": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB",
    "time": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.00",
    "message": "TRACKER_IMPORT_JOB ( mEfEaFSCKCC ) started by admin ( xE7jOejl9FI ) Import:Start",
    "completed": true,
    "id": "mEfEaFSCKCC"
  }
]
```

Additionally, the following endpoint will return the import summary of the import job. This import summary will only be available after the import has completed:

`GET /tracker/jobs/{uid}/report`

| Parameter|Description|Example
|---|---|---|
|path `/{uid}`| The UID of an existing tracker import job | ABCDEF12345
|`reportMode`| The level of the report to return | `FULL`&#124;`ERRORS`&#124;`WARNINGS`|

#### ***REQUEST*** example

`GET /tracker/jobs/mEfEaFSCKCC/report`

#### ***RESPONSE*** example

The [response payload](#sample-responses) is the same as the one returned after a sync import request.

> **Note**
>
> Both endpoints are used primarily for async import; however, `GET /tracker/jobs/{uid}` would also work for sync requests as it eventually uses the same import process and logging as async requests.

### Import Summary Structure

Import summaries have the following overall structure, depending on the requested `reportMode`:
```json
{
  "status": "...",
  "validationReport": { },
  "stats": { },
  "timingsStats": { },
  "bundleReport": { },
  "message" : { }
}
```

***status***

The property, `status`, of the import summary indicates the overall status of the import. If no errors or warnings were raised during the import, the `status` is reported as `OK`. The presence of any error or warnings in the import will result in a status of type `ERROR` or `WARNING`.

`status` is based on the presence of the most significant `validationReport`. `ERROR` has the highest significance, followed by `WARNING` and finally `OK`. This implies that `ERROR` is reported as long as a single error was found during the import, regardless of how many warnings occurred.

> **Note**
>
> If the import is performed using the AtomicMode "OBJECT", where the import will import any data without validation errors, the overall status will still be `ERROR` if any errors were found.

***validationReport***

The `validationReport` might include `errorReports` and `warningReports` if any errors or warnings were present during the import. When present, they provide a detailed list of any errors or warnings encountered.

For example, a validation error while importing a `TRACKED_ENTITY`:
```json
{
  "validationReport": {
    "errorReports": [
      {
        "message": "Could not find TrackedEntityType: `Q9GufDoplCL`.",
        "errorCode": "E1005",
        "trackerType": "TRACKED_ENTITY",
        "uid": "Kj6vYde4LHh"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "warningReports" : [ ... ]
  }
}
```

The report contains a message and a code describing the actual error (See the [error codes](#error-codes) section for more information about errors). Additionally, the report includes the `trackerType` and `uid`, which aims to describe where in the data the error was found. In this case, there was a `TRACKED_ENTITY` with the uid `Kj6vYde4LHh`, which had a reference to a tracked entity type that was not found.

> **Note**
>
> When referring to the `uid` of tracker objects, they are labeled as their object names in the payload. For example, the `uid` of a tracked entity would in the payload have the name "trackedEntity". The same goes for "enrollment", "event" and "relationship" for enrollments, events, and relationships, respectively.
>
> If no uid is provided in the payload, the import process will generate new uids. This means the error report might refer to a uid that does not exist in your payload.
>
> Errors represent issues with the payload which the importer can not circumvent. Any errors will block that data from being imported. Warnings, on the other hand, are issues where it's safe to circumvent them, but the user should be made aware that it happened. Warnings will not block data from being imported.

***stats***

The stats provide a quick overview of the import. After an import is completed, these will be the actual counts representing how much data was created, updated, deleted, or ignored.

Example:
```json
{
  "stats": {
    "created": 2,
    "updated": 2,
    "deleted": 1,
    "ignored": 5,
    "total": 10
  }
}
```
`created` refers to how many new objects were created. In general, objects without an existing uid in the payload will be treated as new objects.

`updated` refers to the number of objects updated. If an object has a uid set in the payload, it will be treated as an update as long as that same uid exists in the database.

`deleted` refers to the number of objects deleted during the import. Deletion only happens when the import is configured to delete data and only then when the objects in the payload have existing uids set.

`ignored` refers to objects that were not persisted. Objects can be ignored for several reasons, for example trying to create something that already exists. Ignores should always be safe, so if something was ignored, it was not necessary, or it was due to the configuration of the import.

***timingsStats***

`timingStats` represents the time elapsed in different steps of the import. These stats do not provide an accurate overall time for the import but rather the time spent in the code for different steps.

The `timingStats` are primarily helpful in debugging imports that are causing issues to see which part of the import is having issues.
```json
{
  "timingsStats": {
    "timers": {
      "preheat": "0.234086 sec.",
      "preprocess": "0.000058 sec.",
      ...
      "totalImport": "0.236810 sec.",
      "validation": "0.001533 sec."
    }
  }
}
```

***bundleReport***

When the import is completed, the `bundleReport` contains all the [tracker objects](#tracker-objects) imported.

For example, `TRACKED_ENTITY`:
```json
{
  "bundleReport": {
    "status": "OK",
    "typeReportMap": {
      "TRACKED_ENTITY": {
        "trackerType": "TRACKED_ENTITY",
        "stats": {
          "created": 1,
          "updated": 0,
          "deleted": 0,
          "ignored": 0,
          "total": 1
        },
        "objectReports": [
          {
            "trackerType": "TRACKED_ENTITY",
            "uid": "FkxTQC4EAKK",
            "index": 0,
            "errorReports": []
          }
        ]
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
As seen, each type of tracker object will be reported, and each has its own stats and `objectReports`. These `objectReports` will provide details about each imported object, like their type, their uid, and any error or warning reports is applicable.

***message***

If the import ended abruptly, the `message` would contain further information in relation to what happened.

### Import Summary Report Level

As previously stated, `GET /tracker/jobs/{uid}/report` can be retrieved using a specific `reportMode` parameter. By default the endpoint will return an `importSummary` with `reportMode` `ERROR`.

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `FULL` | Returns everything from `WARNINGS`, plus `timingsStats` |
| `WARNINGS` | Returns everything from `ERRORS`, plus `warningReports` in `validationReports` |
| `ERRORS` (default) | Returns only `errorReports` in `validationReports` |

In addition, all `reportModes` will return `status`, `stats`, `bundleReport` and `message` when applicable.

### Error Codes { #webapi_nti_error_codes }

There are various error codes for different error scenarios. The following table has the list of error codes thrown from the new Tracker API, along with the error messages and some additional descriptions. The placeholders in the error messages (`{0}`,`{1}`,`{2}`..) are usually uids unless otherwise specified.

| Error Code | Error Message | Description |
|:--|:----|:----|
| E1000 | User: `{0}`, has no write access to OrganisationUnit: `{1}`. | This typically means that the OrganisationUnit `{1}` is not in the capture scope of the user `{0}` for the write operation to be authorized. |
| E1001 | User: `{0}`, has no data write access to TrackedEntityType: `{1}`. | The error occurs when the user is not authorized to create or modify data of the TrackedEntityType `{1}`  
| E1002 | TrackedEntityInstance: `{0}`, already exists. | This error is thrown when trying to create a new TrackedEntity with an already existing uid. Make sure a new uid is used when adding a new TrackedEntity. |
| E1005 | Could not find TrackedEntityType: `{0}`. | Error thrown when trying to fetch a non existing TrackedEntityType with uid `{0}` . This might also mean that the user does not have read access to the TrackedEntityType. |
| E1006 | Attribute: `{0}`, does not exist. | Error thrown when the system was not able to find a matching TrackedEntityAttribute with uid `{0}`. This might also mean that the user does not have access to the TrackedEntityAttribute. |
| E1007 | Error validating attribute value type: `{0}`; Error: `{1}`. | Mismatch between value type of a TrackedEntityAttribute and its provided attribute value. The actual validation error will be displayed in `{1}`. |
| E1009 | File resource: `{0}`, has already been assigned to a different object. | The File resource uid `{0}` is already assigned to another object in the system. |
| E1010 | Could not find Program: `{0}`, linked to Event. | The system was unable to find a Program with the uid `{0}` specified inside the Event payload. This might also mean that the specific Program is not accessible by the logged in user. |
| E1011 | Could not find OrganisationUnit: `{0}`, linked to Event. | The system was unable to find a OrganisationUnit with uid `{0}` specified inside the Event payload.  |
| E1012 | Geometry does not conform to FeatureType: `{0}`. | FeatureType provided is either NONE or an incompatible one for the provided geometry value. |
| E1013 | Could not find ProgramStage: `{0}`, linked to Event. | The system was unable to find a ProgramStage with uid `{0}` specified inside the Event payload. This might also mean that the ProgramStage is not accessible to the logged in user.  |
| E1014 | Provided Program: `{0}`, is a Program without registration. An Enrollment cannot be created into Program without registration. | Enrollments can only be created for Programs with registration. |
| E1015 | TrackedEntityInstance: `{0}`, already has an active Enrollment in Program `{1}`. | Cannot enroll into a Program if another active enrollment already exists for the Program. The active enrollment will have to be completed first atleast. |
| E1016 | TrackedEntityInstance: `{0}`, already has an active enrollment in Program: `{1}`, and this program only allows enrolling one time. | As per the Program `{1}` configuration, a TrackedEntity can only be enrolled into that Program once.

### Validation { #webapi_nti_validation }

While importing data using the tracker importer, a series of validations are performed to ensure the validity of the data. This section will describe some of the different types of validation performed to provide a better understanding if validation fails for your import.

#### Required properties

Each of the tracker objects has a few required properties that need to be present when importing data. For an exhaustive list of required properties, have a look at the [Tracker Object section](#webapi_nti_tracker_objects).

When validating required properties, we are usually talking about references to other data or metadata. In these cases, there are three main criteria:

1. The reference is present and not null in the payload.
2. The reference points to the correct type of data and exists in the database
3. The user has access to see the reference

If the first condition fails, the import will fail with a message about a missing reference. However, suppose the reference points to something that doesn't exist or which the user cannot access. In that case, both cases will result in a message about the reference not being found.

#### Formats

Some of the properties of tracker objects require a specific format. When importing data, each of these properties is validated against the expected format and will return different errors depending on which property has a wrong format. Some examples of properties that are validated this way:

- UIDs (These cover all references to other data or metadata in DHIS2.)
- Dates
- Geometry (The coordinates must match the format as specified by its type)

#### User access
All data imported will be validated based on the metadata  ([Sharing](#webapi_nti_metadata_sharing)) and the organisation units ([Organisation Unit Scopes](#webapi_nti_ou_scope)) referenced in the data. You can find more information about sharing and organisation unit scopes in the following sections.

Sharing is validated at the same time as references are looked up in the database. Metadata outside of the user's access will be treated as if it doesn't exist. The import will validate any metadata referenced in the data.

Organisation units, on the other hand, serve a dual purpose. It will primarily make sure that data can only be imported when imported for an organisation unit the user has within their "capture scope". Secondly, organisation units are also used to restrict what programs are available. That means if you are trying to import data for an organisation unit that does not have access to the Program you are importing, the import will be invalid.

Users with the `ALL` authority will ignore the limits of sharing and organisation unit scopes when they import data. However, they can not import enrollments in organisation units that do not have access to the enrollment program.

#### Attribute and Data values

Attributes and data values are part of a tracked entity and an event, respectively. However, attributes can be linked to a tracked entity either through its type (TrackedEntityType) or its Program (Program). Additionally, attributes can also be unique.

The initial validation done in the import is to make sure the value provided for an attribute or data element conforms to the type of value expected. For example, suppose you import a value for a data element with a numeric type. In that case, the value is expected to be numeric. Any errors related to a mismatch between a type and a value will result in the same error code but with a specific message related to the type of violation.

Mandatory attributes and data values are also checked. Currently, removing mandatory attributes is not allowed. Some use-cases require values to be sent separately, while others require all values to be sent as one. Programs can be configured to either validate mandatory attributes `ON_COMPLETE` or `ON_UPDATE_AND_INSERT` to accommodate these use-cases.

The import will validate unique attributes at the time of import. That means as long as the provided value is unique for the attribute in the whole system, it will pass. However, if the unique value is found used by any other tracked entity other than the one being imported, it will fail.

#### Configuration

The last part of validations in the importer are validations based on the user's configuration of relevant metadata. For more information about each configuration, check out the relevant sections. Some examples of configurable validations:
- Feature type (For geometry)
- User-assignable events
- Allow future dates
- Enroll once
- And more.

These configurations will further change how validation is performed during import.

### Program Rules { #webapi_nti_program_rules }

Users can configure [Program Rules](#webapi_program_rules), which adds conditional behavior to tracker forms. In addition to running these rules in the tracker apps, the tracker importer will also run a selection of these rules. Since the importer is also running these rules, we can ensure an additional level of validation.

Not all program rule actions are supported since they are only suitable for a frontend presentation. A complete list of the supported program rule actions is presented below.

  |Program Rule Action|Supported|
  |---|:---:|
  |**DISPLAYTEXT**| |
  |**DISPLAYKEYVALUEPAIR**| |
  |**HIDEFIELD**||
  |**HIDESECTION**||
  |**ASSIGN**|**X**|
  |**SHOWWARNING**|**X**|
  |**SHOWERROR**|**X**|
  |**WARNINGONCOMPLETION**|**X**|
  |**ERRORONCOMPLETION**|**X**|
  |**CREATEEVENT**||
  |**SETMANDATORYFIELD**|**X**|
  |**SENDMESSAGE**|**X**|
  |**SCHEDULEMESSAGE**|**X**|

Program rules are evaluated in the importer in the same way they are evaluated in the Tracker apps. To summarize, the following conditions are considered when enforcing the program rules:

* The program rule must be linked to the data being imported. For example, a program stage or a data element.
* The Program rule's condition must be evaluated to true

The results of the program rules depend on the actions defined in those rules:

* Program rule actions may end in 2 different results: Warnings or Errors.
  * Errors will make the validation fail, while the warnings will be reported as a message in the import summary.
    * SHOWWARNING and WARNINGONCOMPLETION actions can generate only Warnings.
    * SHOWERROR, ERRORONCOMPLETION, and SETMANDATORYFIELD actions can generate only Errors.
    * ASSIGN action can generate both Warnings and Errors.
      * When the action is assigning a value to an empty attribute/data element, a warning is generated.
      * When the action is assigning a value to an attribute/data element that already has the same value to be assigned, a warning is generated.
      * When the action is assigning a value to an attribute/data element that already has a value and the value to be assigned is different, an error is generated unless the `RULE_ENGINE_ASSIGN_OVERWRITE` system setting is set to true.

Additionally, program rules can also result in side-effects, like send and schedule messages. More information about side effects can be found in the following section.

> **NOTE**
>
> Program rules can be skipped during import using the `skipProgramRules` parameter.

### Side Effects { #webapi_nti_side_effects }

After an import has been completed, specific tasks might be triggered as a result of the import. These tasks are what we refer to as "Side effects". These tasks perform operations that do not affect the import itself.

Side effects are tasks running detached from the import but are always triggered by an import. Since side effects are detached from the import, they can fail even when the import is successful. Additionally, side effects are only run when the import is successful, so they cannot fail the other way around.

The following side effects are currently supported:

  |Side Effects|Supported|Description|
  |---|:---:|---|
  |**Tracker Notification**|**X**| Updates can trigger notifications. Updates which trigger notifications are **enrollment**, **event update**, **event or enrollment completion**. |
  |**ProgramRule Notification**|**X**| Program rules can trigger notifications. Note that these notifications are part of program rule effects which are generated through the DHIS2 rule engine.|

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > Certain configurations can control the execution of side effects. `skipSideEffects` flag can be set during the import to skip side effects entirely. This parameter can be useful if you import something you don't want to trigger notifications for, as an example.

### Assign user to events { #webapi_nti_user_event_assignment }

Specific workflows benefit from treating events like tasks, and for this reason, you can assign a user to an event.

Assigning a user to an event will not change the access or permissions for users but will create a link between the Event and the user.
When an event has a user assigned, you can query events from the API using the `assignedUser` field as a parameter.

When you want to assign a user to an event, you simply provide the UID of the user you want to assign in the `assignedUser` field. See the following example:

```json
{
  ...
  "events": [
    {
      "event": "ZwwuwNp6gVd",
      "programStage": "nlXNK4b7LVr",
      "orgUnit": "O6uvpzGd5pu",
      "enrollment": "MNWZ6hnuhSw",
      "assignedUser" : "M0fCOxtkURr"
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

In this example, the user with uid `M0fCOxtkURr` will be assigned to the Event with uid `ZwwuwNp6gVd`. Only one user can be assigned to a single event.

To use this feature, the relevant program stage needs to have user assignment enabled, and the uid provided for the user must refer to a valid, existing user.

## Tracker Export { #webapi_nti_export }

Tracker export endpoints are a set of services that allow clients to query and retrieve objects stored using the import endpoint.

Besides differences highlighted in **[Changes in the API](#Changes-in-the-API)**, request parameters for these endpoints match older ones.

These endpoints are still being developed and are subject to change. However, 
the `request` and `response` interfaces will most likely not undergo significant changes.

Tracker export endpoints deal with the following Tracker objects:

- **Tracked Entities**
- **Events**
- **Enrollments**
- **Relationships**

> **NOTE**
>
> - These endpoints currently only support `JSON`, but `CSV` will be supported in the near future.
>
> - These endpoints adopt the new naming convention documented in **[Changes in the API](#Changes-in-the-API)**
>
> - The following functionalities are still missing but available in older endpoints:
>
>     - field filtering

### Common request parameters

The following endpoint supports standard parameters for pagination.

- **Tracked Entities** `GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities`
- **Events** `GET /api/tracker/events`
- **Enrollments** `GET /api/tracker/enrollments`
- **Relationships** `GET /api/tracker/relationships`

#### Request parameters for pagination

|Request parameter|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|`page`|`Integer`| Any positive integer |Page number to return. Defaults to 1 if missing|
|`pageSize`|`Integer`| Any positive integer |Page size. Defaults to 50. |
|`totalPages`|`Boolean`| `true`&#124;`false` |Indicates whether to return the total number of pages in the response |
|`skipPaging`|`Boolean`| `true`&#124;`false` |Indicates whether paging should be ignored and all rows should be returned. Defaults to `false`, meaning that by default all requests are paginated, unless `skipPaging=true`|
|`order`|`String`|comma-delimited list of `OrderCriteria` in the form of `propName:sortDirection`.<br><br> Example: `createdAt:desc`<br><br>**Note:** `propName` is case sensitive, `sortDirection` is case insensitive|Sort the response based on given `OrderCriteria`|

> **Caution**
>
> Be aware that the performance is directly related to the amount of data requested. Larger pages will take more time to return.

#### Request parameters for Organisational Unit selection mode

The available organisation unit selection modes are explained in the
following table.

|Mode|Description|
|---|---|
|`SELECTED`|  Organisation units defined in the request.|
|`CHILDREN`|  The selected organisation units and the immediate children, i.e., the organisation units at the level below.|
|`DESCENDANTS`| The selected organisation units and all children, i.e., all organisation units in the sub-hierarchy.|
|`ACCESSIBLE`|  The data view organisation units associated with the current user and all children, i.e., all organisation units in the sub-hierarchy. Will fall back to data capture organisation units associated with the current user if the former is not defined.|
|`CAPTURE`| The data capture organisation units associated with the current user and all children, i.e., all organisation units in the sub-hierarchy.|
|`ALL`| All organisation units in the system. Requires the ALL authority.|

#### Request parameter to filter responses

All new export endpoints support a `fields` parameter which allows to filter the response based on a simple grammar.

`fields` parameter accepts a comma separated list of field names or patterns and responses are filtered based on it

##### Examples

|Parameter example|Meaning|
|:---|:---|
|`fields=createdAt,uid`| only returns `createdAt` and `uid` fields for the requested object|
|`fields=enrollments.uid`| only returns `uid` field for nested `enrollments`|
|`fields=enrollments[uid]`| same as above with a different syntax|
|`fields=enrollments[uid,enrolledAt]`| only returns `uid` and `enrolledAt` fields for nested `enrollments`|
|`fields=**`| don't filter (same behaviour as not passing the `field` parameter at all)|

### Tracked Entities

Two endpoints are dedicated to tracked entities:

- `GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities`
  - retrieves tracked entities matching given criteria
- `GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities/{id}`
  - retrieves a tracked entity given the provided id

#### Tracked Entities Collection endpoint `GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities`

The purpose of this endpoint is to retrieve tracked entities matching client-provided criteria.

The endpoint returns a list of tracked entities that match the request parameters.

##### Request syntax

|Request parameter|Type|Allowed values|Description|

The query is case insensitive. The following rules apply to the query
parameters.

- At least one organisation unit must be specified using the `orgUnit`
  parameter (one or many), or `ouMode=ALL` must be specified.

- Only one of the `program` and `trackedEntity` parameters can be
  specified (zero or one).

- If `programStatus` is specified, then `program` must also be
  specified.

- If `followUp` is specified, then `program` must also be specified.

- If `enrollmentEnrolledAfter` or `enrollmentEnrolledBefore` is specified then
  `program` must also be specified.

- Filter items can only be specified once.

##### Example requests

A query for all instances associated with a specific organisation unit
can look like this:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?orgUnit=DiszpKrYNg8

To query for instances using one attribute with a filter and one
attribute without a filter, with one organisation unit using the
descendant organisation unit query mode:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?filter=zHXD5Ve1Efw:EQ:A
        &attribure=AMpUYgxuCaE&orgUnit=DiszpKrYNg8;yMCshbaVExv

A query for instances where attributes are included in the response
and one attribute is used as a filter:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?filter=zHXD5Ve1Efw:EQ:A
        &filter=AMpUYgxuCaE:LIKE:Road
        &orgUnit=DiszpKrYNg8

A query where multiple operand and filters are specified for a filter
item:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?orgUnit=DiszpKrYNg8
        &program=ur1Edk5Oe2n
        &filter=lw1SqmMlnfh:GT:150
        &filter=lw1SqmMlnfh:LT:190

To query on an attribute using multiple values in an *IN* filter:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?orgUnit=DiszpKrYNg8
        &filter=dv3nChNSIxy:IN:Scott;Jimmy;Santiago

To constrain the response to instances which are part of a specific
program you can include a program query parameter:

    GET GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?filter=zHXD5Ve1Efw:EQ:A
        &orgUnit=O6uvpzGd5pu&ouMode=DESCENDANTS
        &program=ur1Edk5Oe2n

To specify program enrollment dates as part of the query:

    GET /API/tracker/trackedEntities?
        &orgUnit=O6uvpzGd5pu&program=ur1Edk5Oe2n
        &enrollmentEnrolledAfter=2013-01-01
        &enrollmentEnrolledBefore=2013-09-01

To constrain the response to instances of a specific tracked entity you
can include a tracked entity query parameter:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?filter=zHXD5Ve1Efw:EQ:A
        &orgUnit=O6uvpzGd5pu
        &ouMode=DESCENDANTS
        &trackedEntity=cyl5vuJ5ETQ

By default the instances are returned in pages of size 50, to change
this you can use the page and pageSize query parameters:

    GET /api/tracker/trackedEntities?filter=zHXD5Ve1Efw:EQ:A
        &orgUnit=O6uvpzGd5pu
        &ouMode=DESCENDANTS
        &page=2&pageSize=3

You can use a range of operators for the filtering:

|Operator|  Description|
|---|---|
|`EQ`|  Equal to|
|`GT`|  Greater than|
|`GE`|  Greater than or equal to|
|`LT`|  Less than|
|`LE`|  Less than or equal to|
|`NE`|  Not equal to|
|`LIKE`|  Like (free text match)|
|`IN`|  Equal to one of the multiple values separated by ";"|

##### Response format

The `JSON` response can look like the following.

Responses can be filtered on desired fields, see [Request parameter to filter responses](#Request-parameter-to-filter-responses)

## Tracker Access Control { #webapi_nti_access_control }

Tracker has a few different concepts in regards to access control, like sharing, organisation unit scopes, ownership, and access levels. The following sections provide a short introduction to the different topics.

### Metadata Sharing { #webapi_nti_metadata_sharing }


Sharing setting is standard DHIS2 functionality that applies to both Tracker and Aggregate metadata/data as well as dashboards and visualization items. At the core of sharing is the ability to define who can see/do what. In general, there are five possible sharing configurations – no access, metadata read, metadata write, data read, and data write. These access configurations can be granted at user and/or user group level (for more flexibility). With a focus on Tracker, the following metadata and their sharing setting is of particular importance: Data Element, Category Option, Program, Program Stage, Tracked Entity Type, Tracked Entity Attribute as well as Tracker related Dashboards and Dashboard Items.

How sharing setting works is straightforward – the settings are enforced during Tracker data import/export processes. To read value, one needs to have data read access. If a user is expected to modify data, he/she needs to have data write access. Similarly, if a user is expected to modify metadata, it is essential to grant metadata write access.

One critical point with Tracker data is the need to have a holistic approach. For example, a user won’t be able to see the Data Element value by having read access to just the Data Element. The user needs to have data read to access the parent Program Stage and Program where this Data Element belongs. It is the same with the category option combination. In Tracker, the Event is related to AttributeOptionCombo, which is made up of a combination of Category Options. Therefore, for a user to read data of an Event, he/she needs to have data read access to all Category Options and corresponding Categories that constitute the AttributeOptionCombo of the Event in question. If a user lacks access to just one Category Option or Category, then the user has no access to the entire Event.

When it comes to accessing Enrollment data, it is essential to have access to the Tracked Entity first. Access to a Tracked Entity is controlled through sharing setting of Program, Tracked Entity Type, and Tracked Entity Attribute. Once Enrollment is accessed, it is possible to access Event data, again depending on Program Stage and Data element sharing setting.

Another vital point to consider is how to map out access to different Program Stages of a Program. Sometimes we could be in a situation where we need to grant access to a specific stage – for example, “Lab Result” – to a specific group of users (Lab Technicians). In this situation, we can provide data write access to "Lab Result" stage, probably data read to one or more stages just in case we want Lab Technicians to read other medical results or no access if we think it not necessary for the Lab Technicians to see data other than lab related.

In summary, DHIS2 has a fine-grained sharing setting that we can use to implement access control mechanisms both at the data and metadata level. These sharing settings can be applied directly at the user level or user group level. How exactly to apply a sharing setting depends on the use-case at hand.

For more detailed information about data sharing, check out [Data sharing](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-master/configuring-the-system/about-sharing-of-objects.html#data-sharing-for-event-based-programs).

### Organisation Unit Scopes { #webapi_nti_ou_scope }

Organisation units are one of the most fundamental objects in DHIS2. They define a universe under which a user is allowed to record and/or read data. There are three types of organisation units that can be assigned to a user. These are data capture, data view, and tracker search. As the name implies, these organisation units define a scope under which a user is allowed to conduct the respective operations.

However, to further fine-tune the scope, DHIS2 Tracker introduces a concept that we call **OrganisationUnitSelectionMode**. Such a mode is often used at the time exporting tracker objects. For example, given that a user has a particular tracker search scope, does it mean that we have to use this scope every time a user tries to search for a tracker, Enrollment, or Event object? Or is the user interested in limiting the searching just to the selected org unit, or the entire capture org unit scope, and so on. 

Users can do the fine-tuning by passing a specific value of ouMode in their API request:

*api/tracker/trackedEntities?orgUnit=UID&ouMode=specific_organisation_unit_selection_mode*

Currently, there are six selection modes available: *SELECTED, CHILDREN, DESCENDANTS, CAPTURE, ACCESSIBLE, and ALL*.

1. **SELECTED**: as the name implies, all operations intended by the requesting API narrow down to the selected organisation unit.
2. **CHILDREN**: under this mode, the organisation unit scope will be constructed using the selected organisation unit and its immediate children. 
3. **DESCENDANTS**: here, the selected organisation unit and everything underneath it, not just the immediate children, constitute the data operation universe.
4. **CAPTURE**: as the name implies, organisation units assigned as the user's data capture constitute the universe. Note that, of the three organisation units that can be assigned to a user data capture is the mandatory one. If a user does not have data view and tracker search organisation units, the system will fall back to data capture. This way, we are always sure that a user has at least one universe.
5. **ACCESSIBLE**: technically, this is the same scope as the user's tracker search organisation units.
6. **ALL**: the name ALL makes perfect sense if we are dealing with a superuser. For super users, this scope means the entire organisation unit available in the system. However, for non-superusers, ALL boils down to ACCESSIBLE organisation units.

It makes little sense to pass these modes at the time of tracker import operations. Because when writing tracker data, each of the objects needs to have a specific organisation unit attached to them. The system will then ensure if each of the mentioned organisation units falls under the CAPTURE scope. If not, the system will simply reject the write operation.

Note that there is 4 type of organisation unit associations relevant for Tracker objects. A TrackedEntity has an organisation unit, commonly referred to as the Registration Organisation unit. Enrollments have an organisation unit associated with them. Events also have an organisation unit associated with them. There is also an Owner organisation unit for a TrackedEntity-Program combination. 

When fetching Tracker objects, depending on the context, the organisation unit scope is applied to one of the above four organisation unit associations. 

For example, when retrieving TrackedEntities without the context of a program, the organisation unit scope is applied to the registration organisation unit of the TrackedEntity. Whereas, when retrieving TrackedEntities, including specific program data, the organisation unit scope is applied to the Owner organisation unit. 

  * **Explain how they relate to ownership - Link to Program Ownership**

### Tracker Program Ownership { #webapi_nti_ownership }

A new concept called Tracker Ownership is introduced from 2.30. This introduces a new organisation unit association for a TrackedEntity - Program combination.
We call this the Owner (or Owning) Organisation unit of a TrackedEntity in
the context of a Program. The Owner organisation unit is used to decide access privileges when reading and writing tracker data related to a program.
This, along with the Program's [Access Level](#webapi_nti_access_level) configuration, decides the access behavior for Program-related data (Enrollments and Events). 
A user can access a TrackedEntity's Program data if the corresponding Owner OrganisationUnit for that TrackedEntity-Program combination falls under the user's organisation unit scope (Search/Capture). For Programs that are configured with access level  *OPEN* or *AUDITED* , the Owner OrganisationUnit has to be in the user's search scope.
For Programs that are configured with access level  *PROTECTED* or *CLOSED* , the Owner OrganisationUnit has to be in the user's capture scope to be able to access the corresponding program data for the specific tracked entity.

#### Tracker Ownership Override: Break the Glass { #webapi_nti_tracker_ownership_override }

It is possible to temporarily override this ownership privilege for a
program that is configured with an access level of *PROTECTED*. Any user
will be able to temporarily gain access to the Program related data if
the user specifies a reason for accessing the TrackedEntity-Program
data. This act of temporarily gaining access is termed as *breaking the
glass*. Currently, temporary access is granted for 3 hours. DHIS2
audits breaking the glass along with the reason specified by the user.
It is not possible to gain temporary access to a program that has been
configured with an access level of *CLOSED*. To break the glass for a
TrackedEntity-Program combination, the following POST request can be used:

    /API/33/tracker/ownership/override?trackedEntityInstance=DiszpKrYNg8
      &program=eBAyeGv0exc&reason=patient+showed+up+for+emergency+care

#### Tracker Ownership Transfer { #webapi_nti_tracker_ownership_transfer }

It is possible to transfer the ownership of a TrackedEntity-Program
from one organisation unit to another. This will be useful in case of patient
referrals or migrations. Only a user who has Ownership access (or temporary access by breaking the glass) can transfer the ownership. To transfer ownership of a TrackedEntity-Program to another organisation unit, the following PUT request can be used:

    /API/33/tracker/ownership/transfer?trackedEntityInstance=DiszpKrYNg8
      &program=eBAyeGv0exc&ou=EJNxP3WreNP


### Access Level { #webapi_nti_access_level }

DHIS2 treats Tracker data with an extra level of protection. In addition to the standard feature of metadata and data protection through sharing settings, Tracker data are shielded with additional access level protection mechanisms.  Currently, there are four access levels that can be configured for a Program: Open, Audited, Protected, and Closed.

These access levels are only triggered when users try to interact with program data, namely Enrollments and Events data. The different Access Level configuration for Program is a degree of openness (or closedness) of program data. Note that all other sharing settings are still respected, and the access level is only an additional layer of access control. Here is a short description of the four access levels that can be configured for a Program. 

1. Open: This access level is the least restricted among the access levels. Data inside an OPEN program can be accessed and modified by users if the Owner organisation unit falls under the user's search scope.  With this access level, accessing and modifying data outside the capture scope is possible without any justification or consequence. 
2.  Audited: This is the same as the Open access level. The difference here is that the system will automatically add an audit log entry on the data being accessed by the specific user.
3.  Protected: This access level is slightly more restricted. Data inside a PROTECTED program can only be accessed by users if the Owner organisation unit falls under the user's capture scope. However, a user who only has the Owner organisation unit in the search scope can gain temporary ownership by [breaking the glass](#webapi_nti_tracker_ownership_override). The user has to provide a justification of why they are accessing the data at hand. The system will then put a log of both the justification and access audit and provide temporary access for 3 hours to the user. Note that when breaking the glass, the Owner Organisation Unit remains unchanged, and only the user who has broken the glass gains temporary access. 
4.  Closed: This is the most restricted access level. Data recorded under programs configured with access level CLOSED will not be accessible if the Owner Organisation Unit does not fall within the user's capture scope. It is also not possible to break the glass or gain temporary ownership in this configuration. Note that it is still possible to transfer the ownership to another organisation unit. Only a user who has access to the data can transfer the ownership of a TrackedEntity-Program combination to another Organisation Unit. If ownership is transferred, the Owner Organisation Unit is updated.

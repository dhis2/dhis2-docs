# SMS

## Short Message Service (SMS) { #webapi_sms } 

This section covers the SMS Web API for sending and receiving short text
messages.

### Outbound SMS service

The Web API supports sending outgoing SMS using the POST method. SMS can
be sent to single or multiple destinations. One or more gateways need
to be configured before using the service. An SMS will not be sent if
there is no gateway configured. It needs a set of recipients and
message text in JSON format as shown below.

    /api/sms/outbound

```json
{
  "message":"Sms Text",
  "recipients": [
    "004712341234",
    "004712341235"
  ]
}
```

> **Note**
>
> Recipients list will be partitioned if the size exceeds `MAX_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS` limit of 200.

The Web API also supports a query parameter version, but the
parameterized API can only be used for sending SMS to a single
destination.

    /api/sms/outbound?message=text&recipient=004712341234

Outbound messages can be fetched using GET resource.

    GET /api/sms/outbound
    GET /api/sms/outbound?filter=status:eq:SENT
    GET /api/sms/outbound?filter=status:eq:SENT&fields=*

Outbound messages can be deleted using DELETE resource.

    DELETE /api/sms/outbound/{uid}
    DELETE /api/sms/outbound?ids=uid1,uid2

#### Gateway response codes

Gateway may response with following response codes.



Table: Gateway response codes

| Response code | Response Message | Detail Description |
|---|---|---|
| RESULT_CODE_0 | success | Message has been sent successfully |
| RESULT_CODE_1 | scheduled | Message has been scheduled successfully |

### Inbound SMS service

The Web API supports collecting incoming SMS messages using the POST
method. Incoming messages routed towards the DHIS2 Web API can be
received using this API. The API collects inbound SMS messages and
provides it to listeners for parsing, based on the SMS content (SMS
Command). An example payload in JSON format is given below. Text,
originator, received date and sent date are mandatory parameters. The
rest are optional but the system will use the default value for these
parameters.

    /api/sms/inbound

```json
{
  "text": "sample text",
  "originator": "004712341234",
  "gatewayid": "unknown",
  "receiveddate": "2016-05-01",
  "sentdate":"2016-05-01",
  "smsencoding": "1",
  "smsstatus":"1"
}
```

Inbound messages can be fetched using GET resourcef

    GET /api/sms/inbound
    GET /api/sms/inbound?fields=*&filter=smsstatus=INCOMING

Inbound messages can be deleted using DELETE resource

    DELETE /api/sms/inbound/{uid}
    DELETE /api/sms/inbound?ids=uid1,uid2

To import all un parsed messages

	POST /api/sms/inbound/import



Table: User query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| message | String | This is mandatory parameter which carries the actual text message. |
| originator | String | This is mandatory parameter which shows by whom this message was actually sent from. |
| gateway | String | This is an optional parameter which gives gateway id. If not present default text "UNKNOWN" will be stored |
| receiveTime | Date | This is an optional parameter. It is timestamp at which message was received at the gateway. |

### Gateway service administration

The Web API exposes resources which provide a way to configure and
update SMS gateway configurations.

The list of different gateways configured can be retrieved using a GET
method.

    GET /api/33/gateways

Configurations can also be retrieved for a specific gateway type using
GET method.

    GET /api/33/gateways/{uid}

New gateway configurations can be added using POST. POST api requires type request parameter and currently its value can have either one *http,bulksms,clickatell,smpp*. First added gateway will be set to default. Only one gateway is allowed to be default at one time. Default gateway can only be changed through its api. If default gateway is removed then the next one the list will automatically becomes default.

    POST /api/33/gateways

Configuration can be updated with by providing uid and gateway configurations as mentioned below

    PUT /api/33/gateways/{uids}

Configurations can be removed for specific gateway type using DELETE
method.

    DELETE /api/33/gateways/{uid}

Default gateway can be retrieved and updated.

    GET /api/33/gateways/default

Default gateway can be set using the PUT method.

    PUT /api/33/gateways/default/{uid}

### Gateway configuration

The Web API lets you create and update gateway configurations. For each
type of gateway there are different parameters in the JSON payload.
Sample JSON payloads for each gateway are given below. POST is used to
create and PUT to update configurations. Header parameter can be used in
case of GenericHttpGateway to send one or more parameter as http header.

#### Clickatell

```json
{
  "type" : "clickatell",
  "name" : "clickatell",
  "username": "clickatelluser",
  "authToken": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "urlTemplate": "https://platform.clickatell.com/messages"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "bulksms",
  "name": "bulkSMS",
  "username": "bulkuser",
  "password": "abc123"
}
```

  "typeOfNumber": "UNKNOWN",
  "bindType": "BIND_TX",
  "port": 2775,
  "password":"password",

      "key": "deliveryReport",
      "value": "yes",

In generic http gateway any number of parameters can be added.



Table: Generic SMS gateway parameters

HTTP.OK will be returned if configurations are saved successfully otherwise *Error*

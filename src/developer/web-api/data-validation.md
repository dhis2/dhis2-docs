# Data validation

## Validation { #webapi_validation } 

To generate a data validation summary you can interact with the
validation resource. The dataSet resource is optimized for data entry
clients for validating a data set / form, and can be accessed like this:

    GET /api/33/validation/dataSet/QX4ZTUbOt3a.json?pe=201501&ou=DiszpKrYNg8

In addition to validate rules based on data set, there are two
additional methods for performing validation: Custom validation and
Scheduled validation.

The first path variable is an identifier referring to the data set to
validate. XML and JSON resource representations are supported. The
response contains violations of validation rules. This will be extended
with more validation types in the coming versions.

To retrieve validation rules which are relevant for a specific data set,
meaning validation rules with formulas where all data elements are part
of the specific data set, you can make a GET request to to
`validationRules` resource like this:

    GET /api/validationRules?dataSet=<dataset-id>

The validation rules have a left side and a right side, which is
compared for validity according to an operator. The valid operator
values are found in the table below.



Table: Operators

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| equal_to | Equal to |
| not_equal_to | Not equal to |
| greater_than | Greater than |
| greater_than_or_equal_to | Greater than or equal to |
| less_than | Less than |
| less_than_or_equal_to | Less than or equal to |
| compulsory_pair | If either side is present, the other must also be |
| exclusive_pair | If either side is present, the other must not be |

The left side and right side expressions are mathematical expressions
which can contain references to data elements and category option
combinations on the following format:

    ${<dataelement-id>.<catoptcombo-id>}

The left side and right side expressions have a *missing value
strategy*. This refers to how the system should treat data values which
are missing for data elements / category option combination references
in the formula in terms of whether the validation rule should be checked
for validity or skipped. The valid missing value strategies are found in
the table below.



Table: Missing value strategies

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| SKIP_IF_ANY_VALUE_MISSING | Skip validation rule if any data value is missing |
| SKIP_IF_ALL_VALUES_MISSING | Skip validation rule if all data values are missing |
| NEVER_SKIP | Never skip validation rule irrespective of missing data values |

## Validation results { #webapi_validation_results } 

Validation results are persisted results of violations found during a
validation analysis. If you choose "persist results" when starting or
scheduling a validation analysis, any violations found will be stored in
the database. When a result is stored in the database it will be used
for 3 things:

1.  Generating analytics based on the stored results.

2.  Persisted results that have not generated a notification, will do so,
    once.

3.  Keeping track of whether or not the result has generated a
    notification.

4.  Skipping rules that have been already checked when running
    validation analysis.

This means if you don't persist your results, you will be unable to
generate analytics for validation results, if checked, results will
generate notifications every time it's found and running validation
analysis might be slower.

### Query validation results

The validation results persisted can be viewed at the following
endpoint:

    GET /api/33/validationResults

You can also inspect an individual result using the validation result id
in this endpoint:

    GET /api/33/validationResults/<id>

Validation results can also be filtered by following properties:

* Organisation Unit: `ou=<UID>`
* Validation Rule: `vr=<UID>`
* Period: `pe=<ISO-expression>`

Each of the above filter properties can occur multiple times, for example:

    GET /api/36/validationResults?ou=jNb63DIHuwU&ou=RzgSFJ9E46G

Multiple values for the same filter are combined with OR, results have to match one of the given values.

If more then one filter properties is used these are combined with AND, results have to match one of the values for each of the properties.

For the period filter matching results have to overlap with any of the specified periods.

In addition the validation results can also be filtered on their creation date:

    GET /api/36/validationResults?createdDate=<date>

This filter can be combined with any of the other filters.    

### Trigger validation result notifications

Validation results are sent out to the appropriate users once every day,
but can also be manually triggered to run on demand using the following
API endpoint:

    POST /api/33/validation/sendNotifications

Only unsent results are sent using this endpoint.

### Delete validation results

Validation results can be manually deleted by ID,

    DELETE /api/36/validationResults/<id>

or using filters

    DELETE /api/36/validationResults?<filters>

Supported filter parameters include:

* `ou=<UID>` to match all validation results of an organisation unit; multiple units combine OR when the parameter is provided more than once
* `vr=<UID>` to match all validation results of a validation rule; multiple rules combine OR when the parameter is provided more than once
* `pe=<ISO-expression>` to match all validation results related to a period that overlaps with the specified period
* `created=<ISO-expression>` to match all validation results that were created within the provided period
* `notificationSent=<boolean>` to match either only validation results for which a notification was or wasn't sent

If filters are combined all conditions have to be true (AND logic).

Some examples:

To delete all validation results related the organisation unit with UID `NqwvaQC1ni4` for Q1 of 2020 use:

```
DELETE /api/36/validationResults?ou=NqwvaQC1ni4&pe=2020Q1
```

To delete all validation results that were created in week 1 of 2019 and for which notification has been sent use:

```
DELETE /api/36/validationResults?created=2019W1&notificationSent=true
```

Any delete operation will require the authority _Perform maintenance tasks_.


## Outlier detection

The outlier detection endpoint allows for detecting outliers in aggregate data values.

```
GET /api/36/outlierDetection
```

This endpoint supports two algorithms for detecting outliers:

* **Z-score:** The z-score is defined as the absolute deviation between the score and mean divided by the standard deviation. A threshold parameter referring to the number of standard deviations from the mean must be specified with the z-score algorithm to define the upper and lower boundaries for what is considered an outlier value.
* **Modified Z-score:** Same as z-score except it uses the median instead of the mean as measure of central tendency. Parameters are same as for Z-score.
* **Min-max:** Min-max data element values refers to custom boundaries which can be inserted in DHIS 2 based on data element, org unit and category option combination.

The outlier values will be *ordered according to significance*, by default by the absolute deviation from the mean, with the most significant value first. This is helpful to quickly identify the outlier values which have the biggest impact on data quality and data analytics.

### Request query parameters

The following query parameters are supported.

| Query parameter | Description                                                  | Mandatory | Options (default first)                   |

[*]  You must specify either data sets with the `ds` parameter, which will include all data elements in the data sets, _or_ specify data elements with the `de` parameter.

At least one data set or data element, start date and end date, and at least one organisation unit must be defined.

The `startDate` and `endDate` parameters are mandatory and refer to the time interval for which you want to detect outliers. The `dataStartDate` and `dataEndDate` parameters are optional and refer to the time interval for the data to use when calculating the mean and std dev, which are used to eventually calculate the z-score.

| Parameter  | Description                                                  | Mandatory | Options (default first)                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| ou         | Organisation unit, can be specified multiple times.          | Yes       | Organisation unit identifier.             |
| ds         | Data set, can be specified multiple times.                   | No [*]    | Data set identifier.                      |

[*]  You must specify either data sets with the `ds` parameter, which will include all data elements in the data sets, _or_ specify data elements with the `de` parameter.
     Equally, either `startDate` and `endDate` _or_ `period` must be specified.

The `startDate` and `endDate` parameters refer to the time interval for which you want to detect outliers.
If a period `pe` is provided instead the interval start and end is that of the period.

If no option combos `coc` are provided all data elements of numeric value type are considered.


## Data integrity { #webapi_data_integrity } 

The data integrity capabilities of the data administration module are
available through the web API. This section describes how to run the
data integrity process as well as retrieving the result. The details of
the analysis performed are described in the user manual.

### Running data integrity { #webapi_data_integrity_run } 

The operation of measuring data integrity is a fairly resource (and
time) demanding task. It is therefore run as an asynchronous process and
only when explicitly requested. Starting the task is done by forming an
empty POST request to the *dataIntegrity* endpoint:

    POST /api/dataIntegrity

If successful the request will return HTTP 202 immediately. The location
header of the response points to the resource used to check the status
of the request. The payload also contains a json object of the job
created. Forming a GET request to the given location yields an empty
JSON response if the task has not yet completed and a JSON taskSummary
object when the task is done. Polling (conservatively) to this resource
can hence be used to wait for the task to finish.

### Fetching integrity summary { #webapi_data_integrity_fetch_results } 

Once data integrity is finished running the result can be fetched from
the `system/taskSummaries` resource like so:

    GET /api/system/taskSummaries/DATA_INTEGRITY

The returned object contains a summary for each point of analysis,
listing the names of the relevant integrity violations. As stated in the
leading paragraph for this section the details of the analysis (and the
resulting data) can be found in the user manual chapter on Data
Administration.

## Complete data set registrations { #webapi_complete_data_set_registrations } 

This section is about complete data set registrations for data sets. A
registration marks as a data set as completely captured.

### Completing data sets { #webapi_completing_data_sets } 

This section explains how to register data sets as complete. This is
achieved by interacting with the *completeDataSetRegistrations*
resource:

    GET /api/33/completeDataSetRegistrations

The endpoint supports the *POST* method for registering data set
completions. The endpoint is functionally very similar to the
*dataValueSets* endpoint, with support for bulk import of complete
registrations.

Importing both *XML* and *JSON* formatted payloads are supported. The
basic format of this payload, given as *XML* in this example, is like
so:

```xml
<completeDataSetRegistrations xmlns="http://dhis2.org/schema/dxf/2.0">
  <completeDataSetRegistration period="200810" dataSet="eZDhcZi6FLP"
    organisationUnit="qhqAxPSTUXp" attributeOptionCombo="bRowv6yZOF2" storedBy="imported"/>
  <completeDataSetRegistration period="200811" dataSet="eZDhcZi6FLP"
    organisationUnit="qhqAxPSTUXp" attributeOptionCombo="bRowv6yZOF2" storedBy="imported"/>
</completeDataSetRegistrations>
```

The *storedBy* attribute is optional (as it is a nullable property on
the complete registration object). You can also optionally set the
*date* property (time of registration) as an attribute. It the time is
not set, the current time will be used.

The import process supports the following query parameters:



Table: Complete data set registrations query parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|---|---|---|
| dataSetIdScheme | id &#124; name &#124; code &#124; attribute:ID | Property of the data set to use to map the complete registrations. |
| orgUnitIdScheme | id &#124; name &#124; code &#124; attribute:ID | Property of the organisation unit to use to map the complete registrations. |
| attributeOptionComboIdScheme | id &#124; name &#124; code &#124; attribute:ID | Property of the attribute option combos to use to map the complete registrations. |
| idScheme | id &#124; name &#124; code &#124; attribute:ID | Property of all objects including data sets, org units and attribute option combos, to use to map the complete registrations. |
| preheatCache | false &#124; true | Whether to save changes on the server or just return the import summary. |
| dryRun | false &#124; true | Whether registration applies to sub units |
| importStrategy | CREATE &#124; UPDATE &#124; CREATE_AND_UPDATE &#124; DELETE | Save objects of all, new or update import status on the server. |
| skipExistingCheck | false &#124; true | Skip checks for existing complete registrations. Improves performance. Only use for empty databases or when the registrations to import do not exist already. |
| async | false &#124; true | Indicates whether the import should be done asynchronous or synchronous. The former is suitable for very large imports as it ensures that the request does not time out, although it has a significant performance overhead. The latter is faster but requires the connection to persist until the process is finished. |

The `idScheme`, `dataSetIdScheme`, `orgUnitIdScheme`, `attributeOptionComboIdScheme`, 
`dryRun` and `strategy` (note the dissimilar naming to parameter `importStrategy`) 
can also be set as part of the payload.
In case of XML these are attributes, in case of JSON these are members in the
`completeDataSetRegistrations` node.

For example:
```xml
<completeDataSetRegistrations xmlns="http://dhis2.org/schema/dxf/2.0"
      orgUnitIdScheme="CODE">
    <completeDataSetRegistration period="200810" dataSet="eZDhcZi6FLP"
    organisationUnit="OU_559" attributeOptionCombo="bRowv6yZOF2" storedBy="imported"/>
</completeDataSetRegistrations>
```

Should both URL parameter and payload set a scheme the payload takes precedence. 

### Reading complete data set registrations { #webapi_reading_complete_data_sets } 

This section explains how to retrieve data set completeness
registrations. We will be using the *completeDataSetRegistrations*
resource. The query parameters to use are these:



Table: Data value set query parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| dataSet | Data set identifier, multiple data sets are allowed |
| period | Period identifier in ISO format. Multiple periods are allowed. |
| startDate | Start date for the time span of the values to export |
| endDate | End date for the time span of the values to export |
| created | Include only registrations which were created since the given timestamp |
| createdDuration | Include only registrations which were created within the given duration. The format is <value\><time-unit\>, where the supported time units are "d", "h", "m", "s" *(days, hours, minutes, seconds).* The time unit is relative to the current time. |
| orgUnit | Organisation unit identifier, can be specified multiple times. Not applicable if orgUnitGroup is given. |
| orgUnitGroup | Organisation unit group identifier, can be specified multiple times. Not applicable if orgUnit is given. |
| children | Whether to include the children in the hierarchy of the organisation units |
| limit | The maximum number of registrations to include in the response. |
| idScheme | Identifier property used for meta data objects in the response. |
| dataSetIdScheme | Identifier property used for data sets in the response. Overrides idScheme. |
| orgUnitIdScheme | Identifier property used for organisation units in the response. Overrides idScheme. |
| attributeOptionComboIdScheme | Identifier property used for attribute option combos in the response. Overrides idScheme. |
The `dataSet` and `orgUnit` parameters can be repeated in order to include multiple data sets and organisation units.

The `period`, `startDate`,  `endDate`, `created` and `createdDuration` parameters provide multiple ways to set the time dimension for the request, thus only
one can be used. For example, it doesn't make sense to both set the start/end date and to set the periods.

An example request looks like this:

```bash
GET /api/33/completeDataSetRegistrations?dataSet=pBOMPrpg1QX&dataSet=pBOMPrpg1QX
  &startDate=2014-01-01&endDate=2014-01-31&orgUnit=YuQRtpLP10I
  &orgUnit=vWbkYPRmKyS&children=true
```

You can get the response in *xml* and *json* format. You can indicate which response format you prefer through the *Accept* HTTP header like
in the example above. For xml you use *application/xml*; for json you use *application/json*.

### Un-completing data sets { #webapi_uncompleting_data_sets } 

This section explains how you can un-register the completeness of a data set. To un-complete a data set you will interact with the completeDataSetRegistrations resource:

    GET /api/33/completeDataSetRegistrations

This resource supports *DELETE* for un-registration. The following query
parameters are supported:



Table: Complete data set registrations query parameters

| Query parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ds | Yes | Data set identifier |
| pe | Yes | Period identifier |
| ou | Yes | Organisation unit identifier |
| cc | No (must combine with cp) | Attribute combo identifier (for locking check) |
| cp | No (must combine with cp) | Attribute option identifiers, separated with ; for multiple values (for locking check) |
| multiOu | No (default false) | Whether registration applies to sub units |

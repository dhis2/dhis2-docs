# Settings and configuration

## System settings { #webapi_system_settings } 

You can manipulate system settings by interacting with the
*systemSettings* resource. A system setting is a simple key-value pair,
where both the key and the value are plain text strings. To save or
update a system setting you can make a *POST* request to the following URL:

    /api/33/systemSettings/my-key?value=my-val

Alternatively, you can submit the setting value as the request body,
where content type is set to "text/plain". As an example, you can use
curl like this:

```bash
curl "play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/systemSettings/my-key" -d "My long value"
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -u admin:district
```

To set system settings in bulk you can send a JSON object with a
property and value for each system setting key-value pair using a POST request:

```json
{
  "keyApplicationNotification": "Welcome",
  "keyApplicationIntro": "DHIS2",
  "keyApplicationFooter": "Read more at dhis2.org"
}
```

Translations for translatable Setting keys can be set by specifying locale as
a query parameter and translated value which can be specified
either as a query param or withing the body payload. See an example URL:

    /api/33/systemSettings/<my-key>?locale=<my-locale>&value=<my-translated-value>

You should replace my-key with your real key and my-val with your real
value. To retrieve the value for a given key (in JSON or plain text)
you can make a *GET* request to the following URL:

    /api/33/systemSettings/my-key

Alternatively, you can specify the key as a query parameter:

    /api/33/systemSettings?key=my-key

You can retrieve specific system settings as JSON by repeating the key
query parameter:

```bash
curl "play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/systemSettings?key=keyApplicationNotification&key=keyApplicationIntro"
  -u admin:district
```

You can retrieve all system settings with a GET request:

    /api/33/systemSettings

To retrieve a specific translation for a given translatable key you can specify
a locale as query param:

    /api/33/systemSettings/<my-key>?locale=<my-locale>

If present, the translation for the given locale is returned. Otherwise, a default
value is returned. If no locale is specified for the translatable key, the user default
UI locale is used to fetch the correct translation. If the given translation is not
present, again, the default value is returned.

The priority for translatable keys is the following:

    specified locale > user's default UI locale > defaut value

To delete a system setting, you can make a *DELETE* request to the URL
similar to the one used above for retrieval. If a translatable key is
used, all present translations will be deleted as well.

To delete only a specific translation of translatable key, the same URL
as for adding a translation should be used and the empty value should be
provided:

    /api/33/systemSettings/<my-key>?locale=<my-locale>&value=

The available system settings are listed below.

## User settings { #webapi_user_settings } 

You can manipulate user settings by interacting with the *userSettings*
resource. A user setting is a simple key-value pair, where both the key
and the value are plain text strings. The user setting will be linked to
the user who is authenticated for the Web API request. To return a list
of all user settings, you can send a *GET* request to the following URL:

    /api/33/userSettings

User settings not set by the user, will fall back to the equivalent
system setting. To only return the values set explicitly by the user,
you can append ?useFallback=false to the above URL, like this:

    /api/33/userSettings?useFallback=false

To save or update a setting for the currently authenticated user you can
make a *POST* request to the following URL:

    /api/33/userSettings/my-key?value=my-val

You can specify the user for which to save the setting explicitly with
this syntax:

    /api/33/userSettings/my-key?user=username&value=my-val

Alternatively, you can submit the setting value as the request body,
where content type is set to "text/plain". As an example, you can use
curl like this:

```bash
curl "https://play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/userSettings/my-key" -d "My long value"
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -u admin:district
```

As an example, to set the UI locale of the current user to French you
can use the following command.

```bash
curl "https://play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/userSettings/keyUiLocale?value=fr"
  -X POST -u admin:district
```

You should replace my-key with your real key and my-val with your real
value. To retrieve the value for a given key in plain text you can make
a *GET* request to the following URL:

    /api/33/userSettings/my-key

To delete a user setting, you can make a *DELETE* request to the URL
similar to the one used above for retrieval.

The available system settings are listed below.



Table: User settings

| Key | Options | Description |
|---|---|---|
| keyStyle | light_blue/light_blue.css &#124; green/green.css &#124; vietnam/vietnam.css | User interface stylesheet. |

## Configuration { #webapi_configuration } 

To access configuration you can interact with the *configuration*
resource. You can get XML and JSON responses through the *Accept* header
or by using the .json or .xml extensions. You can *GET* all properties
of the configuration from:

    /api/33/configuration

You can send *GET* and *POST* requests to the following specific
resources:

    GET /api/33/configuration/systemId

    GET POST DELETE /api/33/configuration/feedbackRecipients

    GET POST DELETE /api/33/configuration/offlineOrganisationUnitLevel

    GET POST /api/33/configuration/infrastructuralDataElements

    GET POST /api/33/configuration/infrastructuralPeriodType

    GET POST DELETE /api/33/configuration/selfRegistrationRole

    GET POST DELETE /api/33/configuration/selfRegistrationOrgUnit

For the CORS whitelist configuration you can make a POST request with an
array of URLs to whitelist as payload using "application/json" as
content-type, for instance:

```json
["www.google.com", "www.dhis2.org", "www.who.int"]
```

    GET POST /api/33/configuration/corsWhitelist

For POST requests, the configuration value should be sent as the request
payload as text. The following table shows appropriate configuration
values for each property.



Table: Configuration values

| Configuration property | Value |
|---|---|
| feedbackRecipients | User group ID |
| offlineOrganisationUnitLevel | Organisation unit level ID |

As an example, to set the feedback recipients user group you can invoke
the following curl command:

```bash
curl "localhost/api/33/configuration/feedbackRecipients" -d "wl5cDMuUhmF"
  -H "Content-Type:text/plain"-u admin:district
```

## Read-only configuration { #webapi_readonly_configuration_interface } 

To access all configuration settings and properties you can use the read-only configuration endpoint. This will provide read-only access to *UserSettings, SystemSettings and DHIS2 server configurations* You can get XML and JSON responses through the *Accept* header. You can *GET* all settings from:

    /api/33/configuration/settings

You can get filtered settings based on setting type:

    GET /api/33/configuration/settings/filter?type=USER_SETTING

    GET /api/33/configuration/settings/filter?type=CONFIGURATION

More than one type can be provided:

    GET /api/33/configuration/settings/filter?type=USER_SETTING&type=SYSTEM_SETTING



Table: SettingType values

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| USER_SETTING | To get user settings |
| SYSTEM_SETTING | To get system settings |
| CONFIGURATION | To get DHIS server settings |

> **Note**
>
> Fields which are confidential will be provided in the output but without values.

## Tokens { #webapi_tokens } 

The *tokens* resource provides access tokens to various services.

### Google Service Account { #webapi_tokens_google_service_account } 

You can retrieve a Google service account OAuth 2.0 access token with a
GET request to the following resource.

    GET /api/tokens/google

The token will be valid for a certain amount of time, after which
another token must be requested from this resource. The response
contains a cache control header which matches the token expiration. The
response will contain the following properties in JSON format.



Table: Token response

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| access_token | The OAuth 2.0 access token to be used when authentication against Google services. |
| expires_in | The number of seconds until the access token expires, typically 3600 seconds (1 hour). |
| client_id | The Google service account client id. |

This assumes that a Google service account has been set up and configured for DHIS2. Please consult the installation guide for more info.

## Static content { #webapi_static_content } 

The *staticContent* resource allows you to upload and retrieve custom
logos used in DHIS2. The resource lets the user upload a file with an
associated key, which can later be retrieved using the key. Only PNG
files are supported and can only be uploaded to the `logo_banner` and
`logo_front` keys.

    /api/33/staticContent



Table: Static content keys

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| logo_banner | Logo in the application top menu on the left side. |
| logo_front | Logo on the login-page above the login form. |

To upload a file, send the file with a *POST* request to:

    POST /api/33/staticContent/<key>

Example request to upload logo.png to the `logo_front` key:

```bash
curl -F "file=@logo.png;type=image/png" "https://play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/staticContent/logo_front"
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -u admin:district
```

Uploading multiple files with the same key will overwrite the existing
file. This way, retrieving a file for any given key will only return the
latest file uploaded.

To retrieve a logo, you can *GET* the following:

    GET /api/33/staticContent/<key>

Example of requests to retrieve the file stored for `logo_front`:

* Adding "Accept: text/html" to the HTTP header.*__ In this case, the endpoint will return a default image if nothing is defined. Will return an image stream when a custom or default image is found.

```bash
curl "https://play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/staticContent/logo_front"
  -H "Accept: text/html" -L -u admin:district
```

* Adding "Accept: application/json" to the HTTP header.*__ With this parameter set, the endpoint will never return a default image if the custom logo is not found. Instead, an error message will be returned. When the custom image is found this endpoint will return a JSON response containing the path/URL to the respective image.

```bash
curl "https://play.dhis2.org/demo/api/33/staticContent/logo_front"
  -H "Accept: application/json" -L -u admin:district
```

Success and error messages will look like this:

```json
{
  "images": {
    "png": "http://localhost:8080/dhis/api/staticContent/logo_front"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "httpStatus": "Not Found",
  "httpStatusCode": 404,
  "status": "ERROR",
  "message": "No custom file found."
}
```

To use custom logos, you need to enable the corresponding system
settings by setting it to *true*. If the corresponding setting is false,
the default logo will be served.

## UI customization { #webapi_ui_customization } 

To customize the UI of the DHIS2 application you can insert custom
JavaScript and CSS styles through the *files* resource.

```
POST GET DELETE /api/33/files/script
POST GET DELETE /api/33/files/style
```

The JavaScript and CSS content inserted through this resource will be loaded by the
DHIS2 web application. This can be particularly useful in certain situations:

  - Overriding the CSS styles of the DHIS2 application, such as the
    login page or main page.

  - Defining JavaScript functions which are common to several custom
    data entry forms and HTML-based reports.

  - Including CSS styles which are used in custom data entry forms and
    HTML-based reports.

### Javascript { #webapi_customization_javascript } 

To insert Javascript from a file called *script.js* you can interact
with the *files/script* resource with a POST request:

```bash
curl --data-binary @script.js "localhost/api/33/files/script"
  -H "Content-Type:application/javascript" -u admin:district
```

Note that we use the `--data-binary` option to preserve formatting of the
file content. You can fetch the JavaScript content with a GET request:

    /api/33/files/script

To remove the JavaScript content you can use a DELETE request.

### CSS { #webapi_customization_css } 

To insert CSS from a file called *style.css* you can interact with the
*files/style* resource with a POST-request:

```bash
curl --data-binary @style.css "localhost/api/33/files/style"
  -H "Content-Type:text/css" -u admin:district
```

You can fetch the CSS content with a GET-request:

    /api/33/files/style

To remove the JavaScript content you can use a DELETE request.

# Integration concepts

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:integration-->

DHIS2 is an open platform and its implementers are active contributors
to interoperability initiatives, such as openHIE. The DHIS2 application
database is designed with flexibility in mind. Data structures such as
data elements, organisation units, forms and user roles can be defined
completely freely through the application user interface. This makes it
possible for the system to be adapted to a multitude of local contexts
and use-cases. DHIS2 supports many requirements for routine data capture
and analysis emerging in country implementations, both for HMIS
scenarios and as a basic data collection and management system in
domains such as [logistics, laboratory management and
finance](#Integration_and_interoperability).

## Integration and interoperability

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:Integration_and_interoperability-->

Based on its platform approach, DHIS2 is able to receive and host data
from different data sources and share it to other systems and reporting
mechanisms. An important distinction of integration concepts is the
difference between data integration and systems interoperability:

  - When talking about **integration**, we think about the process of
    making different information systems appear as one, making
    electronic data available to all relevant users as well as the
    harmonization of definitions and dimensions so that it is possible
    to combine the data in useful ways.

  - A related concept is **interoperability**, which is one strategy to
    achieve integration. We consider DHIS2 interoperable with other
    software applications because of its capability to exchange data.
    For example, DHIS2 and OpenMRS are interoperable, because they allow
    to share data definitions and data with each other. Interoperability
    depends on standards for data formats, interfaces, codes and
    terminologies. These would ideally be internationally agreed-upon
    standards, but in practice may also consist of de facto standards
    (which has wide acceptance and usage but is not necessarily formally
    balloted in a standards development organisation) and other more
    local agreements within a particular context.

DHIS2 is often used as an integrated data warehouse, since it contains
(aggregate) data from various sources, such as [Mother and Child health,
Malaria program, census data, and data on stocks and human
resources](#Objectives_of_integration). These data sources share the
same platform, DHIS2, and are available all from the same place. These
subsystems are thus considered integrated into one system.

Interoperability in addition will integrate data sources from other
software applications. For example, if census data is stored in a
specialized [civil registry or in a vital events
system](#Health_information), interoperability between this database and
DHIS2 would mean that census data would also be accessible in DHIS2.

Finally, the most basic integration activity (that is not always taken
into account in the interoperability discussion) is the possibility to
integratedata from existing paper systems or parallel vertical systems
into DHIS2. Data will be entered directly into DHIS2 without passing
through a different software application. This process is based on
creating consistent indicator definitions and can already greatly reduce
fragmentation and enhance data analysis through an integrated data
repository.

## Objectives of integration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:Objectives_of_integration-->

In most countries we find many different, **isolated** health
information systems, causing many information management challenges.
Public Health Information System have seen an explosive and often
uncoordinated growth over the last years. Modern information technology
makes it less costly to implement ICT4D solutions, which can lead to a
high diversity of solutions. A staggering example was the mHealth
moratorium declaration of UgandaÂ´s MoH in 2012, as a reaction to an
avalanche of around [50 mHealth
solutions](http://www.ictworks.org/2012/02/22/ugandan-mhealth-moratorium-good-thing)
that were implemented within the course of a few years. Most of these
solutions were standalone approaches that did not share their data with
the national systems and rarely were developed beyond pilot status.

This may lead to the conclusion, that all systems should be connected or
that **interoperability is an objective** in itself. However DHIS2 is
often employed in contexts, where infrastructure is weak, and where
resources to run even basic systems reliably are scarce. Fragmentation
is a serious problem in this context, however interoperability
approaches can only resolve some of the fragmentation problems - and
often interoperability approaches result in an additional layer of
complexity.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Example: Complexity of Logistics solutions in Ghana</strong></p>
<p>In the area of Logistics or Supply Chain Management, often a multitude of parallel, overlapping or competing software solutions can be found in a single country. As identified in a <a href="http://docplayer.net/23773118-Ghana-landscape-analysis-of-supply-chain-management-software-tools-in-use.html">JSI study in 2012</a>, eighteen (18!) different software tools were documented as being used within the public health supply chain in Ghana alone.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Systems interoperability therefore seems as one possibility to remove
fragmentation and redundancies and give public health officers a concise
and balanced picture from available data sources. However the effort of
connecting many redundant software solutions would be very high and
therefore seems questionable. In a first step, focus should be on
**reducing the number of parallel systems**and identifying the most
relevant systems, afterwards these relevant systems can be integrated.

On this background, we want to define the major objectives of DHIS2
integration approaches:

  - **Calculation of indicators**: Many indicators are based on
    numerators and denominators from different data sources. Examples
    include mortality rates, including some mortality data as numerator
    and population data as denominator, staff coverage and staff
    workload rates (human resource data, and population and headcount
    data), immunization rates, and the like. For the calculation, you
    need both the numerator and denominator data, and they should thus
    be integrated into a single data warehouse. The more data sources
    that are integrated, the more indicators can be generated from the
    central repository.

  - **Reduce manual processing** and entering of data: With different
    data at the same place, there is no need to manually extract and
    process indicators, or re-enter data into the data warehouse.
    Especially interoperability between systems of different data types
    (such as patient registers and aggregate data warehouse) allows
    software for subsystems to both calculate and share data
    electronically. This reduces the amount of manual steps involved in
    data processing, which increases data quality.

  - **Reduce redundancies**: Often overlapping and redundant data is
    being captured by the various parallel systems. For instance will
    HIV/AIDS related data elements be captured both by both multiple
    general counselling and testing programs and the specialized
    HIV/AIDS program. Harmonizing the data collection tools of such
    programs will reduce the total workload of the end users. This
    implies that such data sources can be integrated into DHIS2 and
    harmonized with the existing data elements, which involves both data
    entry and data analysis requirements.

  - Improve **organizational aspects**: If all data can be handled by
    one unit in the ministry of health, instead of various subsystems
    maintained by the several health programs, this one unit can be
    professionalized. With staff which sole responsibility is data
    management, processing, and analysis, more specialized skills can be
    developed and the information handling be rationalized.

  - Integration of **vertical programs**: The typical government health
    domain has a lot of existing players and systems. An integrated
    database containing data from various sources becomes more valuable
    and useful than fragmented and isolated ones. For instance when
    analysis of epidemiological data is combined with specialized
    [HIV/AIDS, TB, financial and human resource data, or when
    immunization is combined with logistics/stock](#nn) data, it will
    give a more complete picture of the situation.

DHIS2 can help streamlining and **simplifying system architecture**,
following questions such as:What is the objective of the integration
effort? Can DHIS2 help reduce the number of systems? Can an DHIS2
integration help provide relevant management information at a lower
cost, at at higher speed and with a better data quality than the
existing systems? Is DHIS2 the best tool to replace other systems, or is
another fit-for-purpose solution that can interoperate with DHIS2 more
appropriate? More practical information on defining these objectives can
be found in [*STEP 1 of the 6-Step implementation
guideline*](https://www.dhis2.org/downloads).

## Health information exchange

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:Health_information-->

Since there are different use-cases for health information, there are
different types of software applications functioning within the health
sector. We use the term architecture for health information to describe
a plan or overview of the various software applications, their specific
uses and data connections. The architecture functions as a plan to
coordinate the development and interoperability of various subsystems
within the larger health information system. It is advisable to develop
a plan that covers all components, including the areas that are
currently not running any software, to be able to adequately see the
requirements in terms of data sharing. These requirements should then be
part of specifications for the software once it is developed or
procured.

The **[openhealth information exchange (openHIE)](https://ohie.org/)**
is an interoperable interpretation of this architecture, with an HMIS or
DHIS2 often assuming a significant role in it.The openHIE framework has
been developed with a clear focus on countries in low resource settings,
through the participation of several institutions and development
partners, including the Oslo HISP program.

The schematic overview below shows the main elements of the openHIE
framework, containing a component layer, an interoperability services
layer and external systems. The openHIE component layer covers meta or
reference data (Terminology, Clients, Facilities), Personal data (Staff,
Patient History) and national health statistics. The purpose is to
ensure the availability of the same meta data in all systems that
participate in the corresponding data exchange (e.g. indicator
definitions, facility naming, coding and classification). In some cases,
like the case of the Master Facility Registry, the data may also be used
to provide information to the general public through a web portal. While
the interoperability layer ensures data brokerage between the different
systems, the external systems layer contains several sub-systems, many
at point of service level, with often overlapping functional range.

There are different approaches to define an eHealth architecture. In the
context of this DHIS2 guideline, we distinguish between approaches based
on a 1:1 connection versus approaches based on an n:n connection
(many-to-many).

### *1:1* integration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:integrationSection-->

In many countries a national HMIS is often the first system to be rolled
out to a large number of facilities and to manage a large number of data
on a monthly or quarterly basis. When countries start to develop their
health system architecture further, DHIS2 often will be connected to
some other systems. This connection is often done directly through a
simple script, which automates a data transfer.

We talk of a 1:1 connection because it is limited to two systems. In the
case of an LMIS/HMIS integration, one LMIS will transfer data to DHIS2
as defined in the script. This hands-on approach often represents a
first step and is one of the most common use cases on the way to an
interoperable openHIE architecture. However, this simplicity also brings
along disadvantages: In case a second logistics system would want to
transfer data to DHIS2 (e.g. commodity data for a specific disease
program), a second script would have to be written, to perform this
task. These two scripts would then run independently from another,
resulting in two separate 1:1 connections.

### *n:n* integration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:nn-->

A different approach is based on placing a purpose-built software to
serve as an **interoperability layer** or BUS approach, managing the
data transfer between possibly several systems on either side (n:n).
This could be the case if for example you wanted to collect stock level
data through different LMIS applications, and then share it to a central
warehouse LMIS, the HMIS and some vertical disease programs system. The
openHIE reference software to assume this role is the ["OpenHIM"](http://openhim.org), but
systems like ["MOTECH"](https://motechproject.org/) have also been used
for this purpose as will be discussed below.

While this approach may result in a higher initial effort, it promises
to make further integration project easier, because the interoperability
layer is being alimented with definitions and mappings that can be
re-used for connecting the next systems.

In practice, there are certain challenges to this approach. It takes a
considerable effort of qualified resources to activate APIs and with
each new release of any involved system, data flows require re-testing
and if necessary adaptations. Also, to be successful these
implementation projects typically have to go through a series
of[*complex steps*](https://www.dhis2.org/downloads), such as the
agreement on an interoperability approach embedded in the national
eHealth strategy, the definition of data standards and sustainable
maintenance structure, and attaining a stakeholder consensus on data
ownership and sharing policies. There can be some long term consequences
when data and systems are knitted together - it creates new roles, jobs
and tasks which didn't exist before and may not have been planned for
(metadata governance, complex system administration, boundary
negotiators, etc.).

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Example: Grameen DHIS2/CommCare middle layer in Senegal</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="#integration">Integration concepts</a>, <a href="https://motechproject.org/">MOTECH</a> serves as technical middle layer between an LMIS for mobile data collection at the health facility level (<a href="http://www.commcarehq.org">CommCare</a>) and DHIS2, allowing to define data mapping, transformation rules and data quality checks. The interface is set-up to transfers data from CommCare Supply to DHIS2 whenever data is saved into a CommCare form at facilities. For each commodity, data on consumption, available stock, losses and stock-out data is transferred from CommCare to DHIS2.</p>
<p>The higher initial investment of the Senegal approach hints towards a more ambitious long-term system architecture, foreseeing that the MOTECH platform may in future serve to accommodate further interoperability task. However we do not see any of the country activities tightly embedded in a text-book eHealth architecture, which would clearly define areas of priority, leading systems for each priority and the relations and resulting APIs between these different components. One may argue that interoperability projects are built on a weak foundation if there is no previous consensus on an architectural master plan. On the other hand it is also valuable to allow system initiatives to organically develop, as long as they are rooted in well-founded country needs.</p></td>

### Architecture, standards and mapping

An important element of an eHealth architecture is the inclusion of
**international eHealth standards**. Standards are especially relevant
for n:n connections, less so for direct (1:1) connections.

Some standards are on the technical level (e.g. transmission methods),
other on the contents side (e.g. WHO 100 core indicators). Gradually
aligning national system initiatives to these standards can give
countries access to proven solutions, benefitting from medical and
technological innovation.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Example: Ghana EPI</strong></p>
<p>The Ghana case illustrates how the WHO EPI reporting requirements serves to define standard data in DHIS2. This standardization at the dataset and terminological level is the basis for the system integration. In the area of DHIS2, work is ongoing with WHO to develop standardized datasets, which could in the future open up new opportunities for interoperability and efficiency gains by offering some consistency of metadata across systems, and also encouraging countries to reuse existing solutions.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

At the **language** level, there is a need to be consistent about
definitions. If you have two data sources for the same data, they need
to be comparable. For example, if you collect malaria data from both
standard clinics and from hospitals, this data needs to describe the
same thing if they need to be combined for totals and indicators. If a
hospital is reporting malaria cases by sex but not age group, and other
clinics are reporting by age group but not sex, this data cannot be
analysed according to either of these dimensions (even though a total
amount of cases can be calculated). There is thus a need to agree on
uniform definitions.

In addition to uniform definitions across the various sub-systems,
**data exchange standards** must be adopted if data is to be shared
electronically. The various software applications would need this to be
able to understand each other. DHIS2 is supporting several data formats
for import and export, including the most relevant standard ADX. Other
software applications are also supporting this, and it allows the
sharing of data definitions and aggregate data between them. For DHIS2,
this means it supports import of aggregate data that are supplied by
other applications, such as [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org) (for patient
management) and [iHRIS](https://www.ihris.org/) (for human resources
management).

A crucial element of the architecture is how organize data **mapping**.
Typically the metadata of different systems does not match exactly.
Unless an MoH has been enforcing a consequent data standard policy,
different systems will have different codes and labels for a facility.
one System may call it *District Hospital - 123*, the other system may
refer to it as Malaria Treatment Centre - 15. To be able to transfer
data, somewhere the information that these two facilities correspond
needs to be stored.

In the case of a 1:1 connection, this mapping has to be done and
maintained for every connection, in case of an n:n interoperability
approach, one side of the definitions can be re-used.

In order to assure that the data can flow smoothly, you need to have
clear responsibilities on both sides of the system regarding data
maintenance and troubleshooting. For example, there need to be
previously defined standard procedures for such activities as adding,
renaming, temporarily deactivating or removing a facility on either of
the two systems. Changes of database fields that are included in a
transferred data record need also to be coordinated in a systematic way.

## Aggregate and transactional data

DHIS2 has been expanding its reach into many health systems. Starting
from its familiar grounds of aggregate data sets for routine data it has
included patient related data and then data in the areas of HR, finance,
logistics and laboratory management, moving towards operational or
transactional data.

We can differentiate between transactional and aggregate data. A
**transactional system** (or operational system from a data warehouse
perspective) is a system that collects, stores and modifies detailed
level data. This system is typically used on a day-to-day basis for data
entry and validation. The design is optimized for fast insert and update
performance. DHIS2 can incorporate aggregate data from external data
sources, typically aggregated in the space dimension (the organisation
unit hierarchy), time dimension (over multiple periods) and for
indicator formulas (mathematical expressions including data elements).

When we look at a transactional system, such as a logistics software for
the entire supply chain or parts of it, there is one fundamental
decision to take: Do you need to track all detailed transactions at all
levels, including such operations as returns, transfer between
facilities, barcode reading, batch and expiry management? Or can you get
most of your needed decision insight results using aggregate data?

Supply chains may often be well monitored and to some degree, managed,
as long as data are reliably available where and when they are needed
for operational decisions and for monitoring purposes.. The main
indicators *intake, consumption and stock level at the end of period*can
be managed without electronic transactions and often suffice to give the
big picture of system performance, and may reduce the needs for system
investment.

Being realistic about what data need to be collected, how often, and who
will be using them is important so you donât create systems that fail
due to lack of use or unrealistic expectations about how the data will
be used. Digital logistics management systems can work well when they
are fully integrated into routine workflows and designed to make the
usersâ jobs easier or more efficient.

> **Note**

> The expectation, that more detailed data leads to better logistics

DHIS2 can assume different roles in interoperability scenarios. A common
interoperability scenario is for DHIS2 to receive aggregate data from an
operational system, in which case the operational system adds up the
transactions before passing it on to DHIS2. However, DHIS2 may to a
certain extent also be configured to store detailed transactional data,
receiving it from external systems or through direct data entry in
DHIS2.

On this basis we try making a comparative overview, comparing aggregate
DHIS2 data management with data management of external specialized
system. This can serve as a rough orientation, but is not static since
both the capabilities of DHIS2 and its interpretation by implementers
are broadening with almost each release.

## Different DHIS2 integration scenarios

The different objectives described above lead to different integration
scenarios. DHIS2 can assume multiple **roles** in a system architecture:

  - Data input: data entry (offline, mobile), data import (transactional
    data, aggregate data)

  - Data storage, visualisation and analysis with in-built tools (DWH,
    reports, GIS)

  - Data sharing to external tools (e.g. DVDMT), via web APIs, web apps
    
    In the following paragraphs we discuss the data input and data
    sharing approaches, then we present the example of the vertical
    integration where DHIS2 often assumes all these roles.
    
    The role of DHIS2 to store, visualise and analyse data is discussed
    seperpately in the [data warehouse
    section](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/implementer/html/ch05.html).

### Data input

There are several aspects on how DHIS2 deals with data input. On the
most basic level, DHIS2 serves to replace or at least mirror paper-based
data collection forms, integrating the data electronically. This will
result in **manual data entry** activities at facility or at health
administration level. The next input option is to **import data**. DHIS2
allows to import data through a user interface, which is a method
requiring little technical knowledge, but needs to be executed manually
every time data needs to be made available. A detailed description of
the import functions can be found in the [DHIS2 user
guides](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#import).

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Practical note:</strong></p>
<p>The manual data entry and import approach require relatively little technical effort. They may also be used temporarily to pilot a data integration approach. This allows user to test indicators and reports, without having to employ dedicated technical resources for the development of automated interoperability functions, either through a 1:1 or an n:n connection.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Data sharing

There are three sharing scenarios, (1) a simple [*data
export*](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/user/html/dhis2_user_manual_en_full.html#export),
(2) [*DHIS2 apps and (3) external apps or websites connecting to the
DHIS Web
API*](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/developer/html/dhis2_developer_manual_full.html).
Similar to the import functions described in the data input section, the
most accessible way of data sharing is to use the data export functions
that are available from the user menu, requiring little technical
knowledge.

Due to its modular design DHIS2 can be extended with **additional
software modules, which can be downloaded from the DHIS2**[*App
store*](https://www.dhis2.org/appstore). These software modules can live
side by side with the core modules of DHIS2 and can be integrated into
the DHIS2 portal and menu system. This is a powerful feature as it makes
it possible to extend the system with extra functionality when needed,
typically for country specific requirements as earlier pointed out.

The downside of the software module extensibility is that it puts
several constraints on the development process. The developers creating
the extra functionality are limited to the DHIS2 technology in terms of
programming language and software frameworks, in addition to the
constraints put on the design of modules by the DHIS2 portal solution.
Also, these modules must be included in the DHIS2 software when the
software is built and deployed on the web server, not dynamically during
run-time.

In order to overcome these limitations and achieve a looser coupling
between the DHIS2 service layer and additional software artefacts, the
DHIS2 development team decided to create a **Web API**. This Web API
complies with the rules of the REST architectural style. This implies
that:

  - The Web API provides a navigable and machine-readable interface to
    the complete DHIS2 data model. For instance, one can access the full
    list of data elements, then navigate using the provided hyperlink to
    a particular data element of interest, then navigate using the
    provided hyperlink to the list of forms which this data element is
    part of. E.g. clients will only do state transitions using the
    hyperlinks which are dynamically embedded in the responses.

  - Data is accessed through a uniform interface (URLs) using a
    well-known protocol. There are no fancy transport formats or
    protocols involved - just the well-tested, well-understood HTTP
    protocol which is the main building block of the Web today. This
    implies that third-party developers can develop software using the
    DHIS2 data model and data without knowing the DHIS2 specific
    technology or complying with the DHIS2 design constraints.

  - All data including meta-data, reports, maps and charts, known as
    resources in REST terminology, can be retrieved in most of the
    popular representation formats of the Web of today, such as HTML,
    XML, JSON, PDF and PNG. These formats are widely supported in
    applications and programming languages and gives third-party
    developers a wide range of implementation options.

This Web API can be accessed by different external information system.
The effort needed for developing new information systems and maintaining
them over time is often largely underestimated. Instead of starting from
scratch, a new application can be built on top of the Web API.

Extenal systems can offer different options for visualizing and
presenting DHIS2 data, e.g. in the form of dashboards, GIS and charting
components. Web portals targeted at the health domain can use DHIS2 as
the main source for aggregate data. The portal can connect to the Web
API and communicate with relevant resources such as maps, charts,
reports, tables and static documents. These data views can dynamically
visualize aggregate data based on queries on the organisation unit,
indicator or period dimension. The portal can add value to the
information accessibility in several ways. It can be structured in a
user-friendly way and make data accessible to inexperienced users. An
example for this is the [Tanzania HMIS Web
Portal](https://appstore.hisptanzania.org/).

## DHIS2 maturity model

Taking into account all the above elements on system architecture and
data types, DHIS2 implementers have several options on how to approach
implementations:

  - Focus on transactional or aggregate data

  - Focus on data integration or systems interoperability

Given the efforts required to implement systems interoperability, many
Ministries of Health are going for the pragmatic shortcut of integrating
data such as basic stock level data **directly into their existing
national DHIS2**. As a rapidly evolving platform, DHIS2 has been adding
a lot of functionality over the last years, especially in DHIS2 Tracker.
Taking the example of logistics data, the following main functions are
currently available:

  - Data entry form mirroring the widely used Report and Requisition
    (R\&R) paper form. Data entry by facilities is possible through the
    desktop browser or a mobile app, including in offline mode. These
    electronic forms can be filled by staff based on the paper stock
    cards, that are normally placed next to the commodity in the store
    room.

  - DHIS2 can then produce reports for central level performance
    monitoring, giving commodity and program managers an understanding
    of how the logistics system is functioning.. Depending on how the
    logistics system operates, these data may also be able to support
    operational decision-making although a more complete analysis of
    logistics business processes and users should be conducted first.

  - Stock data can be transformed into logistics indicators, that can be
    put into context with other program indicators, for example
    cross-referencing number of patients treated with a specific
    pathology and corresponding drug consumption.

Although each country that we look at in the use cases has their own
development path towards system integration, some common learnings can
be drawn from their experiences. The maturity model below describes an
evolutionary approach to cope with integration and interoperability
challenges, allowing the different stakeholders in a national Health
System to grow professional analytics and data usage habits.

The maturity model suggests moving from aggregate data to transactional
data and from stand-alone to interoperable systems (using the example of
logistics data).

1.  DHIS2 is often one of the first systems to cover the health
    administration and several facility levels of a country. At first
    core disease indicators are covered (for example corresponding to
    the 100 WHO Core Health Indicators).

2.  In a second phase, different stakeholders seek to complement the
    disease and service delivery data they are reporting with basic LMIS
    data. This can be done on an aggregate basis in DHIS2, e.g. by
    including stock levels and consumption in periodic reports. This
    will provide high level information on logistics system performance
    but may or may not provide sufficient insights to support improved
    logistics system operations.

3.  At a more mature stage, there may be a legitimate need for
    specialized logistics systems, especially when a very detailed
    transactional view is wanted to have a more granular control, (e.g.
    returns, transfers between facilities, batch numbers and expiries,
    etc.). DHIS2 Tracker can offer some event or patient related data
    management functions, but cannot always achieve the degree of
    workflow support provided by other, more specialized solutions.

4.  In a mature technological and managerial environment, the logistics
    transactions can be shared to DHIS2 in an aggregate form, moving
    from a stand-alone to an integrated scenario.

## Implementation steps for successful data and system integration

The purpose of this step-by-step DHIS2 Implementation Guide is to
provide a methodology for implementers to create and support a DHIS2
integration scenario. The guide is based on the best practices and
lessons learned. The guide advocates for a country driven, iterative,
and agile approach that begins with collecting user stories and
functional requirements. The guide is intended as a framework that can
be adapted to the specific context of each country. The content
describes specific examples for each step detailing user stories, data
specifications, job aids and checklists to guide the use of the
reference implementation software. The basic structure, including the 6
steps, are basedon the [OpenHIE implementation
methodology](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/documents/OpenHIE+Planning+and+Implementation+Guides):

**Step 1**: Identify Stakeholders and Motivations for Improved Facility
Data

**Step 2**: Document Facility Registry Specifications and User Stories

**Step 3**: Set Up Initial Instance

**Step 4**: Identify Gaps & Iterative Development via User Testing

**Step 5**: Scaling the Registry Implementation

**Step 6**: Provide Ongoing Support

In addition to these steps related to interoperability, it is also
interesting to reference back to some of the general DHIS2
implementation experiences and best practises given in the sections on
[Recommendations for National HIS
Implementations](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/implementer/html/dhis2_implementation_guide_full.html#d0e86)
and [Setting Up a New
Database](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/implementer/html/dhis2_implementation_guide_full.html#d0e250).
A typical DHIS2 implementation approach which is also vital for
interoperability projects is a **participatory** approach. This approach
stresses to include right from project start [a local
team](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/implementer/html/dhis2_implementation_guide_full.html#d0e255)
with different skills and background to assume responsibility as soon as
possible.

### Step 1: Define strategy, stakeholders and data usage objectives

In a first step, the objectives of the integration project will be
defined. As with every technology project, there should be a clear
**consensus on strategic and functional objectives**. Technological
innovation and feasibility should not be the sole driving force but
rather a clearly defined organisational goal. Therefore this step is
also intended to answer the question: âWhy do we want to connect systems
or integrate data from different sources with DHIS2?â

On a practical level, this leads to questions on the data integration
approach, such as:

  - Do you want to eliminate paper forms or even eliminate data sets
    that are redundant or not needed anymore?

  - Can you integrate the (aggregate) data into DHIS2?

  - Can you integrate the detailed (e.g. patient level or transactional)
    data into DHIS2, using DHIS2 tracker functions?

  - If you want to create a data exchange connection between DHIS2 and
    another system, how do you define ownership and responsibilities?

Activities to answer this question are described below and will lay the
groundwork for an DHIS2 interoperability project.

#### Identify Stakeholders and Motivations

It is in the nature of interoperability projects to have more than one
stakeholder. Stakeholders from different areas need to agree on a common
system approach, for example the team responsible for the national HMIS
(e.g. the M\&E department or Planning Department) and the Logistics
Department in case of an LMIS implementation. These two main areas often
have sub-divisions, e.g. in the logistics area the procurement unit, the
warehousing unit, the transport unit. In addition, stakeholders from
disease specific programs will have their own regimens and commodity
managers. In addition to these local actors, international partners
(agencies, donors, iNGOs, consultancies) are often also involved in the
decision making process.

Therefore itÂ´s interesting to look at the main motivations of the
stakeholders and how to mitigate risks resulting from potential
diverging interests.

  - Central MoH Departments such as **M\&E&**Planning often are the main
    stakeholders for a standardisation of indicators and IT Systems

  - **Central IT departments** have a general interest over (often
    locally controlled) technology choices and ownership, hardware and
    software purchases. They are often dealing with network and hardware
    issues but lack experience dealing with complex web-based
    architectures and data exchanges.

  - **Specialized disease programs** are often under pressure to deliver
    very program specific indicators, both for their own management but
    also responding to donor driven approaches. They may also feel more
    comfortable controlling their proper IT system to be sure their
    needs are prioritized.

  - **Specialized functional areas** (such as Human Resources,
    Logistics, Hospital Management) are often in a sandwich position,
    having to cater to the information needs of several different
    stakeholders, while trying to achieve operational efficiency with
    limited resources.

By identifying who is interested to provide or utilize the data, the
lead implementers can start to form a project team to inform the design
and implementation. One method for characterizing stakeholders involves
grouping interested parties by their functional roles. The existing
infrastructure and procedures are also important to understanding
governance and curation options. Understanding the stakeholders and
their corresponding systems is a critical first step.

#### eHealth System inventory

It is important to get a clear view on the overall IT systems landscape.
This can help make sure that interoperability investment is done to
strengthen the main systems and that the investments contribute to a
**simplification** of the system architecture. For example, if the
system inventory shows that there are a lot of redundant functional
systems, e.g. more than 10 different logistics systems or modules in a
country, the interoperability project should try to contribute to a mid
or long-term rationalization of this situation. This could mean to
participate in a national consensus finding process to identify the most
future-proof solutions, identify national âchampionsâ for each
speciality and develop a roadmap for aligning these systems or data and
removing underutilized or redundant systems.

Also in this context it is interesting to analyse whether simple
indicators can be collected and managed in DHIS2 itself and how this can
complement logistics system improvement efforts (as this is later
explained in an [LMIS example](#lm)). Once the stable and sustainable
systems have been identified, planning for a data exchange with DHIS2
can start.

#### Explore Opportunities and Challenges

The motivations driving an implementation can be detailed by the
perceived opportunities or challenges that stakeholders face. This might
include the desire to share data across systems related to health
facilities for supply chain management, monitoring and evaluation,
health service delivery and many other systems. User stories and use
cases will be documented in depth during Step 2, but a high level vision
of motivations to engage with partners is also needed.

#### Organisation and HR

Clear national policies on data integration, data ownership, routines
for data collection, processing, and sharing, should be in place at the
start of the project. Often some period of disturbance to the normal
data flow will take place during integration, so for many the long-term
prospects of a more efficient system will have to be judged against the
short-term disturbance. Integration is thus often a stepwise process,
where measures need to be taken for this to happen as smoothly as
possible.

Also, having clearly defined **system maintenance and update
procedures** can certainly help to manage interoperability.

<p>As an example, in the case of Ghana DHIS2, a clear yearly system update cycle is in place: Towards the end of each year, new indicators are created and the corresponding paper forms are issued. Staff will receive training and is prepared for data entry. The new form for EPI data was included in this update cycle and EPI staff was prepared for data entry as part of the process. This systematic procedure allows GHS to quickly respond to the needs of stakeholders such as the EPI Programme and accommodate their data and reporting needs with a limited and predictable investment. It puts CHIM in a position to contribute to the rationalization and simplification of the national Health System Architecture, gradually integrating the data management for more <strong>vertical programs</strong>, both on the side of data entry and analytics.</p></td>

</tbody>

A key principle for HISP is to engage the local team in building the
system from the very beginning, with guidance from external experts if
needed, and not to delay knowledge transfer towards the end of the
implementation. Ownership comes first of all from building the system
and owning every step of this process.

### Step 2: Document Specifications and Requirements

  - Collect existing metadata

  - Document data specifications

  - Document user stories

### Step 3: Carry Out Specifications and Identify Gaps

  - Implement the specifications

  - Identify and piroritize incomplete user stories

### Step 4: Iteration and User Testing

  - Agile and iterative development

  - User testing

  - Collect, reconcile and upload data

### Step 5: Scale-Up

  - Confirm user roles and responsibilities

  - User training

  - Critical integrations

### Step 6: Ongoing Support

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:title_nxr_lxp_41b-->

While during the implementation phase a temporary support structure
should be available, afterwards a permanent support structure needs to
be set-up. The main challenge is to have clear responsibilities. In an
ideal situation, we are dealing with two stable systems that each have
already their own clearly defined support structure.

However in reality some recurring challenges may have to be dealt with:
Many Public Health System are undergoing dynamic developments, leading
to changes in data collection needs or calculation of indicators.

Interoperability tends to be a tedious technical and organisational
charge. All of the three described initiatives have consumed a
considerable effort of qualified **resources** to activate APIs. In
addition, with each new release of any involved system, data flows
require re-testing and if necessary adaptations. To be successful these
implementation projects typically have to go through a series of complex
steps, such as the agreement on an interoperability approach embedded in
the national eHealth strategy, the definition of data standards and
sustainable maintenance structure, and attaining a stakeholder consensus
on data ownership and sharing policies. There can be some long term
consequences when data and systems are knitted together - it creates
**new roles, tasks and categories of labour** which need to be planned
for (metadata governance, complex system administration, boundary
negotiators, etc.). A solution could be to discuss the new
responsibilities beforehand, assigning them to job descriptions, teams
and specific positions.

#### Metadata responsibility

Another important area is that of **metadata governance**, particularly
in the scenarios of secondary use of data. In a stand-alone set-up,
metadata, such as facility or commodity codes can be managed without
much consideration of other stakeholderÂ´s needs. But in an
interoperability environment, metadata changes will have effects outside
of the individual system. Metadata governance can be highly formalised
through registries or more manual through human processes.

In order to determine the appropriate approach, is it useful to estimate
the expected *metadata maintenance effort* and the consequences of
unsynchronized metadata across different systems. In the case of the
LMIS/DHIS2 integrations, there are potentially thousands of facility
identifiers that could go out of synch. However normally, facility
identifiers do not change often since the physical infrastructure of
most public health system is relatively constant. As to the commodities,
although regimes and priority drugs may change over time, the number of
datasets is relatively small: The commodity list of a program often
contains less than 20 products. Therefore often it can be practical to
update a commodity manually, and not invest into an interoperability
solutions such as an automated metadata synchronization.

## Specific integration and interoperability use cases

DHIS2 has been expanding its reach into many health systems. Starting
from its familiar grounds of aggregate data sets for routine data it has
included patient related data and then data in the areas of HR, finance,
logistics and laboratory management. This is in line with the
development of DHIS2 in many country settings, where implementers are
pushing the use beyond its originally intended scope.

This is also reflected in the overall system architecture. Since the
expanding functionality of DHIS2 reduces the urgency to introduce or
maintain other specialized systems, the number of potential data
interfaces decreases. This **reduced complexity** in system architecture
is certainly a benefit for a Health System with limited resources.

For several years now, DHIS2 has grown its data management activities
organically, allowing the actual usage to lead to sometimes unforeseen
solutions. However, there are also limits to where leveraging DHIS2
seems useful. In the following sections, special systems will be
described.

### Logistics Management

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:lm-->

**a) Introduction**

Logistics Management Systems **(LMIS)** or Supply Chain Management
Systems **(SCM)** serve to replace paper systems to increase
standardization, transparency, timeliness of procurement, efficiency,
safety, cost-effectiveness, and to reduce waste. National SCMS/LMIS can
cover such functions as commodity planning, budgeting, procurement,
storage, distribution and replenishment of essential drugs and
consumables.

**b) Implementing LMIS in DHIS2**

Supply chains can often be well controlled with aggregate data only, as
long as data is provided reliably from all relevant levels and followed
up upon. The main indicators intake, consumption and stock level at the
end of period can be managed without electronic transactions and often
suffice to give the big picture, reducing the needs for system
investment. As a rapidly evolving platform, DHIS2 has been adding a lot
of functionality over the last years, especially in DHIS2 Tracker. The
following main functions are currently available:

  - Data entry form mirroring the widely used Report and Requisition
    (R\&R) paper form. Data entry by facilities is possible through the
    desktop browser or a mobile app, including in offline mode. In
    online mode the form can calculate requisition proposals, offering
    the facility manager to modify the request and comment on it. These
    electronic forms can be filled by staff based on the paper stock
    cards, that are normally placed next to the commodity in the store
    room.

  - DHIS2 can then produce reports for central decision making, giving
    commodity and program managers the possibility to accept or modify
    delivery suggestions.

  - Stock data can be transformed into logistics indicators, that can be
    put into context with other program indicators, for example
    cross-referencing number of patients treated with a specific
    pathology and corresponding drug consumption.

**c) Interoperability Options**

LMIS is an area where a multitude of parallel, overlapping or competing
software solutions can be found in a single country. As identified in a
JSI study in 2012(Ghana Ministry of Health, July 2013: Landscape
Analysis of Supply Chain Management Tools in Use), eighteen (18\!)
different software tools were documented as being in use within the
public health supply chain in Ghana alone.

Although a basic LMIS configuration based on aggregate data can take you
very far, in some cases a transactional LMIS is necessary if you need to
track such detailed operations as returns, transfer between facilities,
barcode reading, batch and expiry management. Also some specialized HQ
functions such as creating forecasting, replenishment and elaborate
control reports are often done in specialized tools.

DHIS2 has integrated aggregate data from external systems such as
openLMIS and CommCare through automated data interfaces. As a result,
stock data is available in shared dashboards, displaying health service
and stock data next to each other.

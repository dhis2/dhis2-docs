# Introduction

This guide is designed to assist you in configuring DHIS2 for use with the Android Capture App.

It is not a tutorial or training manual; it is designed to complement the core DHIS2 documentation and training materials with specific reference material for the Android application.

The document is divided into sections, which are intended to describe all the features that have been implemented in the app, those that have not yet been implemented and those that will not be supported. Where applicable, an explanation of problems with the use of a particular feature in Android app will be provided. Recommendations or tips will also be presented for a better understanding and use of the app.

In addition, the document has sections for new features in the login, visual configurations, synchronization management and a list of known important errors.

<!-- PALD: we should reuse the standard "asides" used for DHIS 2 documentation (Note, Tip, Caution, etc.)
- Any issues around using a particular feature with Android are highlighted with an exclamation mark \!
- Every time the icon ![](resources/images/image1_icon.png) is presented, a tip will be provided for a better use and understanding of the feature.

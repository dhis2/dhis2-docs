# Installation

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:installation-->

The installation chapter provides information on how to install DHIS2 in
various contexts, including online central server, offline local
network, standalone application and self-contained package called DHIS2
Live.

## Introduction

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_introduction-->

DHIS2 runs on all platforms for which there exists a Java Runtime
Environment version 8 or higher, which includes most popular operating
systems such as Windows, Linux and Mac. DHIS2 runs on the PostgreSQL
database system. DHIS2 is packaged as a standard Java Web Archive
(WAR-file) and thus runs on any Servlet containers such as Tomcat and
Jetty.

The DHIS2 team recommends Ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating system, PostgreSQL
database system and Tomcat Servlet container as the preferred
environment for server installations.

This chapter provides a guide for setting up the above technology stack.
It should however be read as a guide for getting up and running and not
as an exhaustive documentation for the mentioned environment. We refer
to the official Ubuntu, PostgreSQL and Tomcat documentation for in-depth
reading.

The dhis2-tools Ubuntu package automates many of the tasks described in
the guide below and is recommended for most users, especially those who
are not familiar with the command line or administration of servers. It
is described in detail in a separate chapter in this guide.

## Server specifications

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_server_specifications-->

DHIS2 is a database intensive application and requires that your server
has an appropriate amount of RAM, number of CPU cores and a fast disk.
These recommendations should be considered as rules-of-thumb and not
exact measures. DHIS2 scales linearly on the amount of RAM and number of
CPU cores so the more you can afford, the better the application will perform.

  - *RAM:* At least 1 GB memory per 1 million captured data records per
    month or per 1000 concurrent users. At least 4 GB for a small
    instance, 12 GB for a medium instance.

  - *CPU cores:* 4 CPU cores for a small instance, 8 CPU cores for a
    medium or large instance.

  - *Disk:* Ideally use an SSD. Otherwise use a 7200 rpm disk. Minimum
    read speed is 150 Mb/s, 200 Mb/s is good, 350 Mb/s or better is
    ideal. In terms of disk space, at least 60 GB is recommended, but
    will depend entirely on the amount of data which is contained in the
    data value tables. Analytics tables require a significant amount of
    disk space. Plan ahead and ensure that your server can be upgraded
    with more disk space as it becomes needed.

## Software requirements

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_software_requirements-->

Later DHIS2 versions require the following software versions to operate.

  - Java JDK or JRE version 8 or later.

  - An operating system for which a Java JDK or JRE version 8 exists.

  - PostgreSQL database version 9.6 or later.

  - PostGIS database extension version 2.2 or later.

  - Tomcat servlet container version 8.5.50 or later, or other Servlet API
    3.1 compliant servlet containers.

## Server setup

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_server_setup-->

This section describes how to set up a server instance of DHIS2 on
Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit with PostgreSQL as database system and Tomcat as
Servlet container. This guide is not meant to be a step-by-step guide
per se, but rather to serve as a reference to how DHIS2 can be deployed
on a server. There are many possible deployment strategies, which will
differ depending on the operating system and database you are using, and
other factors. The term *invoke* refers to executing a given command in
a terminal.

For a national server the recommended configuration is a quad-core 2 Ghz
processor or higher and 12 Gb RAM or higher. Note that a 64 bit
operating system is required for utilizing more than 4 Gb of RAM.

For this guide we assume that 8 Gb RAM is allocated for PostgreSQL and 8
GB RAM is allocated for Tomcat/JVM, and that a 64-bit operating system
is used. *If you are running a different configuration please adjust the
suggested values accordingly\!* We recommend that the available memory
is split roughly equally between the database and the JVM. Remember to
leave some of the physical memory to the operating system for it to
perform its tasks, for instance around 2 GB. The steps marked as
*optional*, like the step for performance tuning, can be done at a later
stage.

### Creating a user to run DHIS2

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_creating_user-->

You should create a dedicated user for running DHIS2.

> **Important**
>
> You should not run the DHIS2 server as a privileged user such as root.

Create a new user called dhis by invoking:

```sh
sudo useradd -d /home/dhis -m dhis -s /bin/false
```

Then to set the password for your account invoke:

```sh
sudo passwd dhis
```

Make sure you set a strong password with at least 15 random characters.

### Creating the configuration directory

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_creating_config_directory-->

Start by creating a suitable directory for the DHIS2 configuration
files. This directory will also be used for apps, files and log files.
An example directory could be:

```sh
mkdir /home/dhis/config
chown dhis:dhis /home/dhis/config
```

DHIS2 will look for an environment variable called *DHIS2\_HOME* to
locate the DHIS2 configuration directory. This directory will be
referred to as *DHIS2\_HOME* in this installation guide. We will define
the environment variable in a later step in the installation process.

### Setting server time zone and locale

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_setting_server_tz-->

It may be necessary to reconfigure the time zone of the server to match
the time zone of the location which the DHIS2 server will be covering.
If you are using a virtual private server, the default time zone may not
correspond to the time zone of your DHIS2 location. You can easily
reconfigure the time zone by invoking the below and following the
instructions.

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

PostgreSQL is sensitive to locales so you might have to install your
locale first. To check existing locales and install new ones (e.g.
Norwegian):

```sh
locale -a
sudo locale-gen nb_NO.UTF-8
```

### PostgreSQL installation

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_postgresql_installation-->

Install PostgreSQL by
    invoking:

```sh
sudo apt-get install postgresql-10 postgresql-contrib-10 postgresql-10-postgis-2.4
```

Create a non-privileged user called *dhis* by invoking:

```sh
sudo -u postgres createuser -SDRP dhis
```

Enter a secure password at the prompt. Create a database by invoking:

```sh
sudo -u postgres createdb -O dhis dhis2
```

Return to your session by invoking `exit` You now have a PostgreSQL user
called *dhis* and a database called *dhis2*.

The *PostGIS* extension is needed for several GIS/mapping features to
work. DHIS 2 will attempt to install the PostGIS extension during
startup. If the DHIS 2 database user does not have permission to create
extensions you can create it from the console using the *postgres* user
with the following commands:

```sh
sudo -u postgres psql -c "create extension postgis;" dhis2
```

Exit the console and return to your previous user with *\\q* followed by
*exit*.

### PostgreSQL performance tuning

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_postgresql_performance_tuning-->

Tuning PostgreSQL is necessary to achieve a high-performing system but
is optional in terms of getting DHIS2 to run. PostgreSQL is configured
and tuned through the *postgresql.conf* file which can be edited like
this:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf
```

and set the following properties:

```properties
max_connections = 200
```

Determines maximum number of connections which PostgreSQL will allow.

```properties
shared_buffers = 3200MB
```

Determines how much memory should be allocated exclusively for
PostgreSQL caching. This setting controls the size of the kernel shared
memory which should be reserved for PostgreSQL. Should be set to around
40% of total memory dedicated for PostgreSQL.

```properties
work_mem = 20MB
```

Determines the amount of memory used for internal sort and hash
operations. This setting is per connection, per query so a lot of memory
may be consumed if raising this too high. Setting this value correctly
is essential for DHIS2 aggregation performance.

```properties
maintenance_work_mem = 512MB
```

Determines the amount of memory PostgreSQL can use for maintenance
operations such as creating indexes, running vacuum, adding foreign
keys. Increasing this value might improve performance of index creation
during the analytics generation processes.

```properties
effective_cache_size = 8000MB
```

An estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the
operating system (not an allocation) and isdb.no used by PostgreSQL to
determine whether a query plan will fit into memory or not. Setting it
to a higher value than what is really available will result in poor
performance. This value should be inclusive of the shared\_buffers
setting. PostgreSQL has two layers of caching: The first layer uses the
kernel shared memory and is controlled by the shared\_buffers setting.
PostgreSQL delegates the second layer to the operating system disk cache
and the size of available memory can be given with the
effective\_cache\_size setting.

```properties
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.8
```

Sets the memory used for buffering during the WAL write process.
Increasing this value might improve throughput in write-heavy systems.

```properties
synchronous_commit = off
```

Specifies whether transaction commits will wait for WAL records to be
written to the disk before returning to the client or not. Setting this
to off will improve performance considerably. It also implies that there
is a slight delay between the transaction is reported successful to the
client and it actually being safe, but the database state cannot be
corrupted and this is a good alternative for performance-intensive and
write-heavy systems like DHIS2.

```properties
wal_writer_delay = 10000ms
```

Specifies the delay between WAL write operations. Setting this to a high
value will improve performance on write-heavy systems since potentially
many write operations can be executed within a single flush to disk.

```properties
random_page_cost = 1.1
```

*SSD only.* Sets the query planner's estimate of the cost of a non-sequentially-fetched disk page. A low value will cause the system to prefer index scans over sequential scans. A low value makes sense for databases running on SSDs or being heavily cached in memory. The default value is 4.0 which is reasonable for traditional disks.

```properties
max_locks_per_transaction = 96
```

Specifies the average number of object locks allocated for each transaction. This is set mainly to allow upgrade routines which touch a large number of tables to complete.

Restart PostgreSQL by invoking the following command:

```sh
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
```

### Java installation

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_java_installation-->

The recommended Java JDK for DHIS 2 is OpenJDK 8. OpenJDK is licensed under 
the GPL license and can be run free of charge. You can install it with the
following command:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
```

Verify that your installation is correct by invoking:

```
java -version
```

### DHIS2 configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_database_configuration-->

The database connection information is provided to DHIS2 through a
configuration file called `dhis.conf`. Create this file and save it in
the `DHIS2\_HOME` directory. As an example this location could be:

```sh
/home/dhis/config/dhis.conf
```

A configuration file for PostgreSQL corresponding to the above setup has
these properties:

```properties
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Database connection
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# JDBC driver class
connection.driver_class = org.postgresql.Driver

# Database connection URL
connection.url = jdbc:postgresql:dhis2

# Database username
connection.username = dhis

# Database password
connection.password = xxxx
		
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Server
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enable secure settings if deployed on HTTPS, default 'off', can be 'on'
# server.https = on

# Server base URL
# server.base.url = https://server.com/
```

It is strongly recommended to enable the `server.https` setting and deploying DHIS 2 with an encrypted HTTPS protocol. This setting will enable e.g. secure cookies. HTTPS deployment is required when this setting is enabled.

The `server.base.url` setting refers to the URL at which the system is accessed by end users over the network.

Note that the configuration file supports environment variables. This
means that you can set certain properties as environment variables and
have them resolved, e.g. like this where `DB\_PASSWD` is the
name of the environment variable:

```properties
connection.password = ${DB_PASSWD}
```

Note that this file contains the password for your DHIS2 database in clear
text so it needs to be protected from unauthorized access. To do this, 
invoke the following command which ensures only the *dhis* user is allowed to read it:

```sh
chmod 600 dhis.conf
```

### Tomcat and DHIS2 installation

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_tomcat_dhis2_installation-->

To install the Tomcat servlet container we will utilize the Tomcat user
package by invoking:

```sh
sudo apt-get install tomcat8-user
```

This package lets us easily create a new Tomcat instance. The instance
will be created in the current directory. An appropriate location is the
home directory of the *dhis* user:

```sh
cd /home/dhis/
sudo tomcat8-instance-create tomcat-dhis
sudo chown -R dhis:dhis tomcat-dhis/
```

This will create an instance in a directory called *tomcat-dhis*. Note
that the tomcat7-user package allows for creating any number of dhis
instances if that is desired.

Next edit the file *tomcat-dhis/bin/setenv.sh* and add the lines below.
The first line will set the location of your Java Runtime Environment,
the second will dedicate memory to Tomcat and the third will set the
location for where DHIS2 will search for the *dhis.conf* configuration
file. Please check that the path the Java binaries are correct as they
might vary from system to system, e.g. on AMD systems you might see
*/java-8-openjdk-amd64* Note that you should adjust this to your
environment:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/'
export JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx7500m -Xms4000m'
export DHIS2_HOME='/home/dhis/config'
```

The Tomcat configuration file is located in
*tomcat-dhis/conf/server.xml*. The element which defines the connection
to DHIS is the *Connector* element with port 8080. You can change the
port number in the Connector element to a desired port if necessary. 
The *relaxedQueryChars* attribute is necessary to allow certain characters 
in URLs used by the DHIS2 front-end.

```xml
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
  connectionTimeout="20000"
  redirectPort="8443"
  relaxedQueryChars="[]" />
```

The next step is to download the DHIS2 WAR file and place it into the
webapps directory of Tomcat. You can download the DHIS2 version 2.31 WAR
release like this (replace 2.31 with your preferred version if
necessary):

```sh
wget https://releases.dhis2.org/2.33/dhis.war
```

Alternatively, for patch releases, the folder structure is based on the patch
release ID in a subfolder under the main release. E.g. you can download
the DHIS2 version 2.31.1 WAR release like this (replace 2.31 with your
preferred version, and 2.31.1 with you preferred patch, if necessary):

```
wget https://releases.dhis2.org/2.33/2.33.1/dhis.war
```

Move the WAR file into the Tomcat webapps directory. We want to call the
WAR file ROOT.war in order to make it available at localhost directly
without a context path:

```sh
mv dhis.war tomcat-dhis/webapps/ROOT.war
```

DHIS2 should never be run as a privileged user. After you have modified
the setenv.sh file, modify the startup script to check and verify that the
script has not been invoked as root.

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e

if [ "$(id -u)" -eq "0" ]; then
  echo "This script must NOT be run as root" 1>&2
  exit 1
fi

export CATALINA_BASE="/home/dhis/tomcat-dhis"
/usr/share/tomcat8/bin/startup.sh
echo "Tomcat started"
```

### Running DHIS2

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_running_dhis2-->

DHIS2 can now be started by invoking:

    sudo -u dhis tomcat-dhis/bin/startup.sh

> **Important**
> 
> The DHIS2 server should never be run as root or other privileged user.

DHIS2 can be stopped by invoking:

    sudo -u dhis tomcat-dhis/bin/shutdown.sh

To monitor the behavior of Tomcat the log is the primary source of
information. The log can be viewed with the following command:

    tail -f tomcat-dhis/logs/catalina.out

Assuming that the WAR file is called ROOT.war, you can now access your
DHIS2 instance at the following URL:

    http://localhost:8080

## File store configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_file_store_configuration-->

DHIS2 is capable of capturing and storing files. By default, files will
be stored on the local file system of the server which runs DHIS2 in a *files*
directory under the *DHIS2\_HOME* external directory location. 

You can also configure DHIS2 to store files on cloud-based storage
providers. AWS S3 is the only supported provider currently. To enable
cloud-based storage you must define the following additional properties
in your *dhis.conf* file:

```properties
# File store provider. Currently 'filesystem' and 'aws-s3' are supported.
filestore.provider = 'aws-s3'

# Directory in external directory on local file system and bucket on AWS S3
filestore.container = files

# The following configuration is applicable to cloud storage only (AWS S3)

# Datacenter location. Optional but recommended for performance reasons.
filestore.location = eu-west-1

# Username / Access key on AWS S3
filestore.identity = xxxx

# Password / Secret key on AWS S3 (sensitive)
filestore.secret = xxxx
```

This configuration is an example reflecting the defaults and should be
changed to fit your needs. In other words, you can omit it entirely if
you plan to use the default values. If you want to use an external
provider the last block of properties needs to be defined, as well as the
*provider* property is set to a supported provider (currently only
AWS S3).

> **Note**
> 
> If you’ve configured cloud storage in dhis.conf, all files you upload
> or the files the system generates will use cloud storage.

For a production system the initial setup of the file store should be
carefully considered as moving files across storage providers while
keeping the integrity of the database references could be complex. Keep
in mind that the contents of the file store might contain both sensitive
and integral information and protecting access to the folder as well as
making sure a backup plan is in place is recommended on a production
implementation.

> **Note**
> 
> AWS S3 is the only supported provider but more providers are likely to 
> be added in the future, such as Google Cloud Store and Azure Blob Storage.
> Let us know if you have a use case for additional providers.

## Google service account configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_google_service_account_configuration-->

DHIS2 can connect to various Google service APIs. For instance, the
DHIS2 GIS component can utilize the Google Earth Engine API to load map
layers. In order to provide API access tokens you must set up a Google
service account and create a private key:

  - Create a Google service account. Please consult the [Google identify
    platform](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#overview)
    documentation.

  - Visit the [Google cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
    and go to API Manager \> Credentials \> Create credentials \>
    Service account key. Select your service account and JSON as key
    type and click Create.

  - Rename the JSON key to *dhis-google-auth.json*.

After downloading the key file, put the *dhis-google-auth.json* file in
the DHIS2\_HOME directory (the same location as the *dhis.conf* file).
As an example this location could be:

    /home/dhis/config/dhis-google-auth.json

## LDAP configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_ldap_configuration-->

DHIS2 is capable of using an LDAP server for authentication of users.
For LDAP authentication it is required to have a matching user in the
DHIS2 database per LDAP entry. The DHIS2 user will be used to represent
authorities / user roles.

To set up LDAP authentication you need to configure the LDAP server URL,
a manager user and an LDAP search base and search filter. This
configuration should be done in the main DHIS 2 configuration file
(dhis.conf). LDAP users, or entries, are identified by distinguished
names (DN from now on). An example configuration looks like this:

```properties
# LDAP server URL
ldap.url = ldaps://domain.org:636

# LDAP manager entry distinguished name
ldap.manager.dn = cn=johndoe,dc=domain,dc=org

# LDAP manager entry password
ldap.manager.password = xxxx

# LDAP base search
ldap.search.base = dc=domain,dc=org

# LDAP search filter
ldap.search.filter = (cn={0})
```

The LDAP configuration properties are explained below:

  - *ldap.url:* The URL of the LDAP server for which to authenticate
    against. Using SSL/encryption is strongly recommended in order to
    make authentication secure. As example URL is
    *ldaps://domain.org:636*, where ldaps refers to the protocol,
    *domain.org* refers to the domain name or IP address, and *636*
    refers to the port (636 is default for LDAPS).

  - *ldap.manager.dn:* An LDAP manager user is required for binding to
    the LDAP server for the user authentication process. This property
    refers to the DN of that entry. I.e. this is not the user which will
    be authenticated when logging into DHIS2, rather the user which
    binds to the LDAP server in order to do the authentication.

  - *ldap.manager.password:* The password for the LDAP manager user.

  - *ldap.search.base:* The search base, or the distinguished name of
    the search base object, which defines the location in the directory
    from which the LDAP search begins.

  - *ldap.search.filter:* The filter for matching DNs of entries in the
    LDAP directory. The {0} variable will be substituted by the DHIS2
    username, or alternatively, the LDAP identifier defined for the user
    with the supplied username.

DHIS2 will use the supplied username / password and try to authenticate
against an LDAP server entry, then look up user roles / authorities from
a corresponding DHIS2 user. This implies that a user must have a
matching entry in the LDAP directory as well as a DHIS2 user in order to
log in.

During authentication, DHIS2 will try to bind to the LDAP server using
the configured LDAP server URL and the manager DN and password. Once the
binding is done, it will search for an entry in the directory using the
configured LDAP search base and search filter.

The {0} variable in the configured filter will be substituted before
applying the filter. By default, it will be substituted by the supplied
username. You can also set a custom LDAP identifier on the relevant
DHIS2 user account. This can be done through the DHIS2 user module user
interface in the add or edit screen by setting the "LDAP identifier"
property. When set, the LDAP identifier will be substituted for the {0}
variable in the filter. This feature is useful when the LDAP common name
is not suitable or cannot for some reason be used as a DHIS2 username.

## Encryption configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_encryption_configuration-->

DHIS2 allows for encryption of data. Enabling it requires some extra
setup. To provide security to the encryption algorithm you will have to set a
password in the *dhis.conf* configuration file through the
*encryption.password* property:

```properties
encryption.password = xxxx
```

The *encryption.password* property is the password (key) used when encrypting
and decrypting data in the database. Note that the password must not be
changed once it has been set and data has been encrypted, as the data can
then no longer be decrypted. 

The password must be at least **24 characters long**. A mix of numbers 
and lower- and uppercase letters is recommended. The encryption password 
must be kept secret.

> **Important**
>
> It is not possible to recover encrypted data if the encryption password is lost or changed. If the password is lost, so is the encrypted data. Conversely, the encryption provides no security if 
> the password is compromised. Hence, great consideration should be given to storing the password in a safe place.

Note that encryption support depends on the *Java Cryptography Extension* (JCE) policy files to be available.  These are included in all versions of OpenJDK and Oracle JDK 8 Update 144 or later.

## Read replica database configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_read_replica_configuration-->

DHIS 2 allows for utilizing read only replicas of the master database
(the main DHIS 2 database). The purpose of read replicas is to enhance
the performance of database read queries and scale out the capacity
beyond the constraints of a single database. Read-heavy operations such
as analytics and event queries will benefit from this.

The configuration requires that you have created one or more replicated
instances of the master DHIS 2 database. PostgreSQL achieves this
through a concept referred to as *streaming replication*. Configuring
read replicas for PostgreSQL is not covered in this guide.

Read replicas can be defined in the *dhis.conf* configuration file. You
can specify up to 5 read replicas per DHIS 2 instance. Each read replica
is denoted with a number between 1 and 5. The JDBC connection URL must
be defined per replica. The username and password can be specified; if
not, the username and password for the master database will be used
instead.

The configuration for read replicas in *dhis.conf* looks like the below.
Each replica is specified with the configuration key *readN* prefix,
where N refers to the replica number.

```properties
# Read replica 1 configuration

# Database connection URL, username and password
read1.connection.url = jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.11/dbread1
read1.connection.username = dhis
read1.connection.password = xxxx

# Read replica 2 configuration

# Database connection URL, username and password
read2.connection.url = jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.12/dbread2
read2.connection.username = dhis
read2.connection.password = xxxx

# Read replica 3 configuration

# Database connection URL, fallback to master for username and password
read3.connection.url = jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.13/dbread3
```

Note that you must restart your servlet container for the changes to
take effect. DHIS 2 will automatically distribute the load across the
read replicas. The ordering of replicas has no significance.

## Web server cluster configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_web_server_cluster_configuration-->

This section describes how to set up the DHIS 2 application to run in a
cluster.

### Clustering overview

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_cluster_configuration_introduction-->

Clustering is a common technique for improving system scalability and
availability. Clustering refers to setting up multiple web servers such
as Tomcat instances and have them serve a single application. Clustering
allows for *scaling out* an application in the sense that new servers
can be added to improve performance. It also allows for *high
availability* as the system can tolerate instances going down without
making the system inaccessible to users.

There are a few aspects to configure in order to run DHIS 2
in a cluster.

* Each DHIS 2 instance must specify the other DHIS 2 instance members of 
the cluster in *dhis.conf*.

* A Redis data store must be installed and connection information must 
be provided for each DHIS 2 application instance in *dhis.conf*.

* DHIS 2 instances and servers must share the same *files* folder used for 
apps and file uploads, either through the *AWS S3 cloud filestorage* option 
or a shared network drive.

* A load balancer such as nginx must be configured to distribute Web requests
across the cluster instances.

### DHIS 2 instance cluster configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_cluster_configuration-->

When setting up multiple Tomcat instances there is a need for making the
instances aware of each other. This awareness will enable DHIS 2 to keep
the local data (Hibernate) caches in sync and in a consistent state.
When an update is done on one instance, the caches on the other
instances must be notified so that they can be invalidated and avoid
becoming stale.

A DHIS 2 cluster setup is based on manual configuration of each
instance. For each DHIS 2 instance one must specify the public
*hostname* as well as the hostnames of the other instances participating
in the cluster.

The hostname of the server is specified using the *cluster.hostname*
configuration property. Additional servers which participate in the
cluster are specified using the *cluster.members* configuration
property. The property expects a list of comma separated values where
each value is of the format *host:port*.

The hostname must be visible to the participating servers on the network
for the clustering to work. You might have to allow incoming and
outgoing connections on the configured port numbers in the firewall.

The port number of the server is specified using the *cluster.cache.port*
configuration property. The remote object port used for registry receive
calls is specified using *cluster.cache.remote.object.port*. Specifying
the port numbers is typically only useful when you have multiple cluster
instances on the same server or if you need to explicitly specify the ports 
to match a firewall configuration. When running cluster instances on separate 
servers it is often appropriate to use the default port number and omit 
the ports configuration properties. If omitted, 4001 will be assigned as 
the listener port and a random free port will be assigned as the remote 
object port.

An example setup for a cluster of two web servers is described below.
For *server A* available at hostname *193.157.199.131* the following can
be specified in *dhis.conf*:

```properties
# Cluster configuration for server A

# Hostname for this web server
cluster.hostname = 193.157.199.131

# Ports for cache listener, can be omitted
cluster.cache.port = 4001
cluster.cache.remote.object.port = 5001

# List of Host:port participating in the cluster
cluster.members = 193.157.199.132:4001
```

For *server B* available at hostname *193.157.199.132* the following can
be specified in *dhis.conf* (notice how port configuration is omitted):

```properties
# Cluster configuration for server B

# Hostname for this web server
cluster.hostname = 193.157.199.132

# List of servers participating in cluster
cluster.members = 193.157.199.131:4001
```

You must restart each Tomcat instance to make the changes take effect.
The two instances have now been made aware of each other and DHIS 2 will
ensure that their caches are kept in sync.

### Redis shared data store cluster configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_cluster_configuration_redis-->

In a cluster setup, a *Redis* instance is required and will handle
shared user sessions, application cache and cluster node leadership.

For optimum performance, *Redis Keyspace events* for _generic commands_ 
and _expired events_ need to be enabled in the Redis Server. If you are 
using a cloud platform-managed Redis server (like *AWS ElastiCache for Redis* 
or *Azure Cache for Redis*) you will have to enable keyspace event notifications 
using the respective cloud console interfaces. If you are setting up a standalone 
Redis server, enabling keyspace event notifications can be done in the 
*redis.conf* file by adding or uncommenting the following line:

```
notify-keyspace-events Egx
```

DHIS2 will connect to Redis if the *redis.enabled* configuration
property in *dhis.conf* is set to *true* along with the following properties:

- *redis.host*: Specifies where the redis server is running. Defaults to *localhost*. Mandatory.

- *redis.port*: Specifies the port in which the redis server is listening. Defaults to *6379*. Optional.

- *redis.password*: Specifies the authentication password. If a password is not required it can be left blank.

- *redis.use.ssl*: Specifies whether the Redis server has SSL enabled. Defaults to false. Optional. Defaults to *false*.

When Redis is enabled, DHIS2 will automatically assign one of the
running instances as the leader of the cluster. The leader instance will
be used to execute jobs or scheduled tasks that should be run
exclusively by one instance. Optionally you can configure the
*leader.time.to.live.minutes* property in *dhis.conf* to set up how
frequently the leader election needs to occur. It also gives an
indication of how long it would take for another instance to take over
as the leader after the previous leader has become unavailable. The
default value is 2 minutes. Note that assigning a leader in the cluster
is only done if Redis is enabled. An example snippet of the *dhis.conf*
configuration file with Redis enabled and leader election time
configured is shown below.

```properties
# Redis Configuration

redis.enabled = true

redis.host = 193.158.100.111

redis.port = 6379

redis.password = <your password>

redis.use.ssl = false

# Optional, defaults to 2 minutes
leader.time.to.live.minutes=4 
```

### Files folder configuration

DHIS 2 will store several types of files outside the application itself,
such as apps, files saved in data entry and user avatars. When deployed
in a cluster, the location of these files must be shared across all instances.
On the local filesystem, the location is:

```
{DHIS2_HOME}/files
```

Here, `DHIS2_HOME` refers to the location of the DHIS 2 configuration file
as specified by the DHIS 2 environment variable, and `files` is the file
folder immediately below.

There are two ways to achieve a shared location:

* Use the *AWS S3 cloud filestorage* option. Files will be stored in an
S3 bucket which is automatically shared by all DHIS 2 instances in the cluster.
See the *File store configuration* section for guidance.
* Set up a shared folder which is shared among all DHIS 2 instances and
servers in the cluster. On Linux this can be achieved with *NFS* (Network File System)
which is a distributed file system protocol. Note that only the `files` 
subfolder under `DHIS2_HOME` should be shared, not the parent folder. 

### Load balancer configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_load_balancing-->

With a cluster of Tomcat instances set up, a common approach for routing
incoming web requests to the backend instances participating in the
cluster is using a *load balancer*. A load balancer will make sure that
load is distributed evenly across the cluster instances. It will also
detect whether an instance becomes unavailable, and if so, stop routine
requests to that instance and instead use other available instances.

Load balancing can be achieved in multiple ways. A simple approach is
using *nginx*, in which case you will define an *upstream* element which
enumerates the location of the backend instances and later use that
element in the *proxy* location block.

```text
http {

  # Upstream element with sticky sessions

  upstream dhis_cluster {
    ip_hash;
    server 193.157.199.131:8080;
    server 193.157.199.132:8080;
  }

  # Proxy pass to backend servers in cluster

  server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
      proxy_pass   http://dhis_cluster/;
    }
  }
}  
```

DHIS 2 keeps server-side state for user sessions to a limited degree.
Using "sticky sessions" is a simple approach to avoid replicating the
server session state by routing requests from the same client to the
same server. The *ip\_hash* directive in the upstream element ensures
this.

Note that several instructions have been omitted for brevity in the
above example. Consult the reverse proxy section for a detailed guide.

## Analytics cache configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_analytics_cache_configuration-->

DHIS 2 supports a server-side cache for analytics API responses, used by all of the analytics web apps. This cache sits within the DHIS 2 application and hence is protected by the DHIS 2 authentication and security layer. You can configure the expiration of cached entries in seconds. To enable the cache you can define the `analytics.cache.expiration` property in `dhis.conf`. The example below enabled the cache and sets expiration to one hour.

```properties
analytics.cache.expiration = 3600
```

## Monitoring

DHIS 2 can export Prometheus compatible metrics for monitoring DHIS2 instances. The DHIS2 monitoring infrastructure is designed to expose metrics related to the application runtime and other application-related information.

Infrastructure related metrics (such as host metrics, Tomcat or Postgres) are not directly exposed by the application monitoring engine and they have to be collected separately. The metrics currently exposed by the application are:

- DHIS 2 API (response time, number of calls, etc.)
- JVM (Heap size, Garbage collection, etc.)
- Hibernate (Queries, cache, etc)
- C3P0 Database pool
- Application uptime
- CPU

Monitoring can be enabled in `dhis.conf` with the following properties (default is `off` for all properties):

```properties
monitoring.api.enabled = on
monitoring.jvm.enabled = on
monitoring.dbpool.enabled = on
monitoring.hibernate.enabled = off
monitoring.uptime.enabled = on
monitoring.cpu.enabled = on
```

The recommended approach for collecting and visualizing these metrics is through Prometheus and Grafana. 

For more information, see the [monitoring infrastructure](https://github.com/dhis2/wow-backend/blob/master/guides/monitoring.md) page and the [Prometheus and Grafana install](https://docs.dhis2.org/master/en/dhis2_system_administration_guide/monitoring.html) chapter.

## Reverse proxy configuration

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_reverse_proxy_configuration-->

A reverse proxy is a proxy server that acts on behalf of a server. Using
a reverse proxy in combination with a servlet container is optional but
has many advantages:

  - Requests can be mapped and passed on to multiple servlet containers.
    This improves flexibility and makes it easier to run multiple
    instances of DHIS2 on the same server. It also makes it possible to
    change the internal server setup without affecting clients.

  - The DHIS2 application can be run as a non-root user on a port
    different than 80 which reduces the consequences of session
    hijacking.

  - The reverse proxy can act as a single SSL server and be configured
    to inspect requests for malicious content, log requests and
    responses and provide non-sensitive error messages which will
    improve security.

### Basic nginx setup

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_basic_nginx_setup-->

We recommend using [nginx](http://www.nginx.org) as a reverse proxy due to
its low memory footprint and ease of use. To install invoke the
following:

    sudo apt-get install nginx

nginx can now be started, reloaded and stopped with the following
commands:

    sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
    sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload
    sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop

Now that we have installed nginx we will now continue to configure
regular proxying of requests to our Tomcat instance, which we assume
runs at *http://localhost:8080*. To configure nginx you can open the
configuration file by invoking:

    sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

nginx configuration is built around a hierarchy of blocks representing
http, server and location, where each block inherits settings from parent
blocks. The following snippet will configure nginx to proxy pass
(redirect) requests from port 80 (which is the port nginx will listen on
by default) to our Tomcat instance. Include the following configuration
in nginx.conf:

```text
http {
  gzip on; # Enables compression, incl Web API content-types
  gzip_types
	"application/json;charset=utf-8" application/json
	"application/javascript;charset=utf-8" application/javascript text/javascript
	"application/xml;charset=utf-8" application/xml text/xml
	"text/css;charset=utf-8" text/css
	"text/plain;charset=utf-8" text/plain;

  server {
	listen               80;
	client_max_body_size 10M;

	# Proxy pass to servlet container

	location / {
	  proxy_pass                http://localhost:8080/;
	  proxy_redirect            off;
	  proxy_set_header          Host               $host;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-Proto  http;
	  proxy_buffer_size         128k;
	  proxy_buffers             8 128k;
	  proxy_busy_buffers_size   256k;
	  proxy_cookie_path         ~*^/(.*) "/$1; SameSite=Lax";
	}
  }
}
```

You can now access your DHIS2 instance at *http://localhost*. Since the
reverse proxy has been set up we can improve security by making Tomcat
only listen for local connections. In */conf/server.xml* you can add an
*address* attribute with the value *localhost* to the Connector element
for HTTP 1.1 like this:

```xml
<Connector address="localhost" protocol="HTTP/1.1" />
```

### Enabling SSL with nginx

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_enabling_ssl_on_nginx-->

In order to improve security it is recommended to configure the server
running DHIS2 to communicate with clients over an encrypted connection
and to identify itself to clients using a trusted certificate. This can
be achieved through SSL which is a cryptographic communication protocol
running on top of TCP/IP. First, install the required *openssl* library:

    sudo apt-get install openssl

To configure nginx to use SSL you will need a proper SSL certificate
from an SSL provider. The cost of a certificate varies a lot depending
on encryption strength. An affordable certificate from [Rapid SSL
Online](http://www.rapidsslonline.com) should serve most purposes. To
generate the CSR (certificate signing request) you can invoke the
command below. When you are prompted for the *Common Name*, enter the
fully qualified domain name for the site you are
    securing.

    openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr

When you have received your certificate files (.pem or .crt) you will
need to place it together with the generated server.key file in a
location which is reachable by nginx. A good location for this can be
the same directory as where your nginx.conf file is located.

Below is an nginx server block where the certificate files are named
server.crt and server.key. Since SSL connections usually occur on port
443 (HTTPS) we pass requests on that port (443) on to the DHIS2 instance
running on *http://localhost:8080* The first server block will rewrite
all requests connecting to port 80 and force the use of HTTPS/SSL. This
is also necessary because DHIS2 is using a lot of redirects internally
which must be passed on to use HTTPS. Remember to replace
*\<server-ip\>* with the IP of your server. These blocks should replace
the one from the previous section.

```text
http {
  gzip on; # Enables compression, incl Web API content-types
  gzip_types
	"application/json;charset=utf-8" application/json
	"application/javascript;charset=utf-8" application/javascript text/javascript
	"application/xml;charset=utf-8" application/xml text/xml
	"text/css;charset=utf-8" text/css
	"text/plain;charset=utf-8" text/plain;

  # HTTP server - rewrite to force use of SSL

  server {
	listen     80;
	rewrite    ^ https://<server-url>$request_uri? permanent;
  }

  # HTTPS server

  server {
	listen               443 ssl;
	client_max_body_size 10M;

	ssl                  on;
	ssl_certificate      server.crt;
	ssl_certificate_key  server.key;

	ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:20m;
	ssl_session_timeout  10m;

	ssl_protocols              TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
	ssl_ciphers                RC4:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
	ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

	# Proxy pass to servlet container

	location / {
	  proxy_pass                http://localhost:8080/;
	  proxy_redirect            off;
	  proxy_set_header          Host               $host;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-Proto  https;
	  proxy_buffer_size         128k;
	  proxy_buffers             8 128k;
	  proxy_busy_buffers_size   256k;
	  proxy_cookie_path         ~*^/(.*) "/$1; SameSite=Lax";
	}
  }
}
```

Note the last `https` header value which is required to inform the
servlet container that the request is coming over HTTPS. In order for
Tomcat to properly produce `Location` URL headers using HTTPS you also need
to add two other parameters to the Connector in the Tomcat `server.xml` file:

```xml
<Connector scheme="https" proxyPort="443" />
```

### Enabling caching with nginx

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_enabling_caching_ssl_nginx-->

Requests for reports, charts, maps and other analysis-related resources
will often take some time to respond and might utilize a lot of server
resources. In order to improve response times, reduce the load on the
server and hide potential server downtime we can introduce a cache proxy
in our server setup. The cached content will be stored in directory
/var/cache/nginx, and up to 250 MB of storage will be allocated. Nginx
will create this directory automatically.

```text
http {
  ..
  proxy_cache_path  /var/cache/nginx  levels=1:2  keys_zone=dhis:250m  inactive=1d;


  server {
	..

	# Proxy pass to servlet container and potentially cache response

	location / {
	  proxy_pass                http://localhost:8080/;
	  proxy_redirect            off;
	  proxy_set_header          Host               $host;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	  proxy_set_header          X-Forwarded-Proto  https;
	  proxy_buffer_size         128k;
	  proxy_buffers             8 128k;
	  proxy_busy_buffers_size   256k;
	  proxy_cookie_path         ~*^/(.*) "/$1; SameSite=Lax";
	  proxy_cache               dhis;
	}
  }
}
```

> **Important**
> 
> Be aware that a server side cache shortcuts the DHIS2 security
> features in the sense that requests which hit the server side cache
> will be served directly from the cache outside the control of DHIS2
> and the servlet container. This implies that request URLs can be
> guessed and reports retrieved from the cache by unauthorized users.
> Hence, if you capture sensitive information, setting up a server side
> cache is not recommended.

### Rate limiting with nginx

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_rate_limiting-->

Certain web API calls in DHIS 2, like the `analytics` APIs, are compute intensive. As a result it is favorable to rate limit these APIs in order to allow all users of the system to utilize a fair share of the server resources. Rate limiting can be achieved with `nginx`. There are numerous approaches to achieving rate limiting and this is intended to document the nginx-based approach.

The below nginx configuration will rate limit the `analytics` web API, and has the following elements at the *http* and *location* block level (the configuration is shortened for brevity):

```text
http {
  ..
  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=limit_analytics:10m rate=5r/s;

  server {
    ..
        
    location ~ ^/api/(\d+/)?analytics(.*)$ {
      limit_req    zone=limit_analytics burst=20;
      proxy_pass   http://localhost:8080/api/$1analytics$2$is_args$args;
      ..
    }
  }
}
```

The various elements of the configuration can be described as:

- *limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr*: Rate limiting is done per request IP.
- *zone=limit_analytics:20m*: A rate limit zone for the analytics API which can hold up to 10 MB of request IP addresses.
- *rate=20r/s*: Each IP is granted 5 requests per second.
- *location ~ ^/api/(\d+/)?analytics(.\*)$*: Requests for the analytics API endpoint are rate limited.
- *burst=20*: Bursts of up to 20 requests will be queued and serviced at a later point; additional requests will lead to a `503`.

For a full explanation please consult the [nginx documentation](https://www.nginx.com/blog/rate-limiting-nginx/).

### Making resources available with nginx

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_making_resources_available_with_nginx-->

In some scenarios it is desirable to make certain resources publicly
available on the Web without requiring authentication. One example is
when you want to make data analysis related resources in the web API
available in a Web portal. The following example will allow access to
charts, maps, reports, report table and document resources through basic
authentication by injecting an *Authorization* HTTP header into the
request. It will remove the Cookie header from the request and the
Set-Cookie header from the response in order to avoid changing the
currently logged in user. It is recommended to create a user for this
purpose given only the minimum authorities required. The Authorization
value can be constructed by Base64-encoding the username appended with a
colon and the password and prefix it "Basic ", more precisely "Basic
base64\_encode(username:password)". It will check the HTTP method used
for requests and return *405 Method Not Allowed* if anything but GET is
detected.

It can be favorable to set up a separate domain for such public users
when using this approach. This is because we don't want to change the
credentials for already logged in users when they access the public
resources. For instance, when your server is deployed at somedomain.com,
you can set a dedicated subdomain at api.somedomain.com, and point URLs
from your portal to this subdomain.

```text
http {
  ..
  
  server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  api.somedomain.com;

    location ~ ^/(api/(charts|chartValues|reports|reportTables|documents|maps|organisationUnits)|dhis-web-commons/javascripts|images|dhis-web-commons-ajax-json|dhis-web-mapping|dhis-web-visualizer) {
    if ($request_method != GET) {
        return 405;
      }

      proxy_pass         http://localhost:8080;
      proxy_redirect     off;
      proxy_set_header   Host               $host;
      proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto  http;
      proxy_set_header   Authorization      "Basic YWRtaW46ZGlzdHJpY3Q=";
      proxy_set_header   Cookie             "";
      proxy_hide_header  Set-Cookie;
    }
  }
}
```

## DHIS2 configuration reference

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_dhis2_configuration_reference-->

The following describes the full set of configuration options for the *dhis.conf* configuration file. The configuration file should be placed in a directory which is pointed to by a *DHIS2\_HOME* environment variable.

## Changelog

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_changelog-->

DHIS2 writes entries to changelogs when certain entities were changed in the system. The entities fall within two categories: _Aggregate_ and _tracker_. The _aggregate_ category includes changes to aggregate data values. The _tracker_ category includes changes to program instances, program temporary ownership items, tracked entity attribute values and tracked entity data values.

The changelog for both categories are enabled by default. You can control whether to enable or disable the changelog by category through the `dhis.conf` configuration file using the properties described below. Property options are `on` (default) and `off`.

The benefit of the changelog is the ability to see changes which have been performed to the data. The benefits of disabling the changelog is a minor performance improvement by avoiding the cost of writing changelog items to the database, and less database storage used. It is recommended to enable changelog, and great care should be taken if disabling it.

```properties
# Aggregate changelog, can be 'on', 'off'
changelog.aggregate = on

# Tracker changelog, can be 'on', 'off'
changelog.tracker = on
```

## Application logging

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_application_logging-->

This section covers application logging in DHIS 2.

### Log files

The DHIS2 application log output is directed to multiple files and locations. First, log output is sent to standard output. The Tomcat servlet container usually outputs standard output to a file under "logs":

    <tomcat-dir>/logs/catalina.out

Second, log output is written to a "logs" directory under the DHIS2 home directory as defined by the DHIS2\_HOME environment variables. There is a main log file for all output, and separate log files for various
background processes. The main file includes the background process logs as well. The log files are capped at 50 Mb and log content is continuously appended.

    <DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis.log    
    <DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis-analytics-table.log
    <DHIS2_HOME>/logs/dhis-data-exchange.log

### Log configuration

In order to override the default log configuration you can specify a Java system property with the name *log4j.configuration* and a value pointing to the Log4j configuration file on the classpath. If you want to point to a
file on the file system (i.e. outside Tomcat) you can use the *file* prefix e.g. like this:

```properties
-Dlog4j.configuration=file:/home/dhis/config/log4j.properties
```

Java system properties can be set e.g. through the *JAVA\_OPTS* environment variable or in the tomcat startup script.

A second approach to overriding the log configuration is to specify logging properties in the *dhis.conf* configuration file. The supported properties are:

```properties
# Max size for log files, default is '100MB'
logging.file.max_size = 250MB

# Max number of rolling log archive files, default is 0
logging.file.max_archives = 2
```

DHIS2 will eventually phase out logging to standard out / catalina.out and as a result it is recommended to rely on the logs under DHIS2\_HOME.

## Working with the PostgreSQL database

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:install_working_with_the_postgresql_database-->

Common operations when managing a DHIS2 instance are dumping and
restoring databases. To make a dump (copy) of your database, assuming
the setup from the installation section, you can invoke the following:

    pg_dump dhis2 -U dhis -f dhis2.sql

The first argument (dhis2) refers to the name of the database. The
second argument (dhis) refers to the database user. The last argument
(dhis2.sql) is the file name of the copy. If you want to compress the
file copy immediately you can do:

    pg_dump dhis2 -U dhis | gzip > dhis2.sql.gz

To restore this copy on another system, you first need to create an
empty database as described in the installation section. You also need
to gunzip the copy if you created a compressed version. You can
invoke:

    psql -d dhis2 -U dhis -f dhis2.sql

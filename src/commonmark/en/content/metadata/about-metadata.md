# About the WHO Digital Health Data Toolkit 
The WHO digital health data toolkit for DHIS2 consists of metadata and tools to facilitate the dissemination of health data standards at global scale. The toolkit is an extension of the [WHO's toolkit for strengthening routine health information systems](https://www.who.int/data/data-collection-tools/analysis-use-health-facility-data). The toolkit brings together WHO standards with UiO's evidence-based system design principles and implementation lessons to help countries leap-frog into an era of digital information at-their-fingertips. The toolkit supports an ever-growing number of national health programs to digitize and integrate their health data according to WHO standards and best practices. 

The digital health data toolkit contains the following resources: 

* **Metadata packages:** Pre-configured template of DHIS2 metadata that can be installed on standalone instance or integrated into a country or organization's existing DHIS2. 
* **Installation guides:** Step-by-step guidance for metadata package installation and adaptation to local context. 
* **System design guides:** Documentation about the configuration and design decisions to support implementers  adapting the package to local contexts.  
* **User training guides:** A collection of training templates for end users tailored to each metadata package. Countries can pick up the training guide off-the-shelf and easily customize for their local context. 

## Types of metadata packages

Several types of DHIS2 metadata packages exist to support the use of both aggregate and tracker data models in DHIS2: 

* **Dashboard & analytics packages** (aggregate) include standard indicators and dashboards that countries can install into their own DHIS2 and map to their existing aggregate metadata. 
* **Complete aggregate packages** includes the dashboard  and indicators from the dashboard package, but also includes data sets and data elements for routine reporting and data validation rules for data quality. This package is recommended when a country is integrating routine aggregate data collection into their system for a given health area for the first time, or when a country has an opportunity to update the data collection forms to ensure standardized reporting. 
* **Tracker packages** include one or more tracker programs for individual-level data collection (individual-level) and related metadata such as program indicators and dashboards. To the extent possible, tracker configurations include the necessary program indicators to populate the data sets of the related aggregate configuration packages.

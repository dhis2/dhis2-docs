# Using the Tracker Capture app

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:tracker_capture_app-->

## About the Tracker Capture app

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_tracker_capture_app-->

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker-capture-tei-list.png)

The **Tracker Capture** app is an advanced version of the **Event
Capture** app.

  - **Event Capture**: handles single events *without* registration

  - **Tracker Capture**: handles multiple events (including single
    event) *with* registration.

  - You capture event data for a registered tracked entity instance
    (TEI).

  - You only see programs associated with the organisation unit you've
    selected and programs you've access to view through your user role.

  - The options you see in the search and register functions depend on
    the program you've selected. The program attributes control these
    options. The attributes also decide the columns names in the TEI
    list.
    
    If you don't select a program, the system picks default attributes.

  - Both skip-logic and validation error/warning messages are supported
    during registration.

  - When you close an organisation unit, you can't register or edit
    events to this organisation unit in the **Tracker Capture** app. You
    can still search for TEIs and filter the search results. You can
    also view the dashboard of a particular TEI.

## About tracked entity instance (TEI) dashboards

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_tracked_entity_instance_dashboard-->

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tei_dashboard.png)

You manage a TEI from the TEI's dashboard in the **Tracker Capture** app.

  - The dashboard consist of widgets. Drag and drop the widgets to place
    them in the order and in the position you want.

  - Click the pin icon to stick the right column of widgets to a fix
    position. This is useful especially during data entry.
    
    If you have many data elements or big form to fill in, stick the
    right widget column. Then all the widgets you've placed in the right
    column remain visible while you scroll in the data entry part.

  - Any indicator defined for the program you've selected will have its
    value calculated and displayed in the **Indicators** widget.

  - Navigation:
    
      - **Back**: takes you back to the search and registration page
    
      - Previous and next buttons: takes you to the previous or next TEI
        dashboard in the TEI search results list
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
      - **Other programs** field: if the TEI is enrolled in other
        programs, they're listed here. Click a program to change the
        program for which you enter data for the selected TEI. When you
        change programs, the content in the widgets change too.

## Workflow

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:workflow_tracker_capture-->

Working process of Mother and child health
program

![](resources/images/patients_programs/name_based_information_tracking_process.png)

1.  Create new or find existing TEI.
    
    You can search on defined attributes, for example name or address.

2.  Enroll TEI in a program.

3.  Based on the services of the program by the time, the app creates an
    activity plan for the TEI.

4.  The TEI is provided with various services depending on the program.
    All services are recorded.

5.  Use information about the individual cases to create reports.

## Linking to the Tracker Capture App

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:linking_to_the_tracker_capture_app-->

### Link to a specific program on the "home screen"
You can share a program selection on the "home screen.

1. Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2. Selecte the program you want to link to.

3. Copy the URL.
    
    * Make sure that the URL contains the "program" parameter.

4. Paste the URL in the sharing method of your choice, for example an
  e-mail or a message within DHIS2.

  > Note: If the program does not exist in the selected organisation unit (that is stored in the local cache) the system will instead
  > select the first available program for that organisation unit. If the local cache is empty/clean and the root organisation unit
  > of the current user does not have the specified program, the system will also here select the first available program for the root
  > organisation unit.

### Linking to TEI dashboard
You can share a TEI dashboard via its web address.

1.  Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2.  Open the dashboard you want to share.

3.  Copy the URL.
    
    Make sure that the URL contains "tei", "program" and "ou"
    (organisation unit) parameters.

4.  Paste the URL in the sharing method of your choice, for example an
    e-mail or a message within DHIS2.
    
    If you're not logged in to DHIS2 when you click the link, you'll be
    asked to do so and then taken to the dashboard.

## Create a TEI and enroll it in a program

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_and_enroll_tracked_entity_instance-->

You can create a TEI and enroll that TEI to a program in one operation:

1.  Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2.  In the organisation unit tree in the left hand pane, select an
    organisation unit.

3.  Select a program.

4.  Click **Register**.

5.  Fill in the required information.

    Both tracked entity type and program can be configured to use a feature type.
    This makes it possible to capture geometry for either the TEI or the enrollment.
    Supported feature type is Point and Polygon. Please see **How to use geometry**.

6. If the selected program is configured to display first stage during registation, 
   all mandatory fields in the stage will have to be filled in. At the end of the stage
   you will also be asked if you want to complete the stage that you have entered data for.
   If you select **Yes**, the stage will have the status completed once saved. If you select **No**, 
   the stage will have the staus active.

7.  If searching for program is configured, a background search will be
    performed on searchable fields to help you prevent registering
    duplicates. If there is any matching TEIs, a blue box will be
    displayed on the right side of the form with the possibility to view
    these matching
TEIs.

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_register_integrated_search.png)

If there is any matching TEIs, click **Continue** to review possible
duplicates before registering a new one.

If there is no matching TEIs, click **Save and continue** or **Save and
add new**

  - **Save and continue**: completes the registration and opens the
    registered TEI's dashboard

  - **Save and add new**: completes the registration but stays on the
    same page. Use this option when you want to register and enroll one
    TEI after another without enter data.

> Note: All mandatory attributes have to be filled in to be able to save. 
> Mandatory attributes are marked with a red star next to the attribute lable.
> If the user has the authority called __"Ignore validation of required fields in Tracker and Event Capture"__
> you will not be required to fill in the mandatory attributes and will 
> not see the red star next to the attribute lable. Note that super user 
> that have the __"ALL"__ authority automatically have this authority.

## Open an existing TEI dashboard

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:open_existing_tracked_entity_instance_dashboard-->

There are multiple ways to find a TEI: Using the "Lists" which is
predefined lists in the current selection, or "Search" for global
lookup.

### Lists

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:simple_tracked_entity_instance_search-->

Lists is used to find and display TEIs in the selected organisation unit
and program.

1.  Open Tracked Capture app

2.  In the organisation unit tree in the left hand pane, select an
    organisation unit

3.  Select a program

4.  Click the "Lists" button if not already selected

If not configured, a set of predefined lists will be available:

1.  Any TEI with any enrollment status

2.  TEIs with an active enrollment of the current program

3.  TEIs with a completed enrollment of the current program

4.  TEIs with a cancelled enrollment of the current program

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_lists.png)

You can select which columns to show or hide in the lists for each
program. This will be saved in your user settings.

1.  Click the **grid** icon button

2.  Check the columns you want to include

3.  Click **Save**

There is also an option to create a custom working list with own
filters. This can be used to create custom lists on the fly.

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_lists_custom.png)

Lists can also be downloaded or printed.

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_lists_download.png)

#### Custom predefined lists

If the program has any custom tracked entity filters associated with it,
these will take the place of the four predefined lists mentioned above.
The predefined lists will when well configured be an effective way to find
or work with the data relevant for the user in that program.

Working lists can be defined with a wide variety of options, here are some
examples:

- Display all TEIs with at least one event in a given program stage that
- has a due date on the current date.
- Display all TEIs that has at least one event that is assigned to the
- logged in user.
- Display all TEIs that is active, but is not assigned to any user.

![Predefined working lists in tracker capture](resources/images/tracker_capture/predefined_working_list_based_on_user_assignment.png)

See the API documentation for a full list of functionality supported for
these predefined tracked entity instance filters.

### Search

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:advanced_tracked_entity_instance_search-->

Search is used to search for TEIs in the organisation units the user has
search access to. This can be used if you want to find a TEI, but you
dont know which organisation unit or program the TEI was enrolled in.
There are two ways of doing this: With and without a program context.
Searchable fields needs to be configured. For configuring searching with
program context, this is done individually for each program in the
program maintenance app. For configuring searching without a program
context, this is done individually for each tracked entity type in the
tracked entity type maintenance app.

**Searching without a program context:**

1.  Open **Tracker Capture app**

2.  Click the **Search** button

3.  Searchable fields will be displayed in groups. Unique attributes is
    only individually searchable. Non-unique attributes can be combined.

4.  Fill in search criteria and click the **search** icon button.

**Searching with a program context:**

1.  Open **Tracker Capture app**

2.  Select an organisation unit which has the program you wish to search
    in

3.  Select the program

4.  Click the **Search** button

5.  Searchable fields will be displayed in groups. Unique attributes is
    only individually searchable. Non-unique attributes can be combined.

6.  Fill in search criteria and click the **search** icon button

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_search_screen.png)

After the search has been done, you will be presented with the search
result. Whats displayed depends on the outcome of the search.

For unique attribute search:

  - If no matching TEI found, you will get the possibility to open the
    registration form.

  - If the TEI was found in the selected organisation unit, the TEI
    dashboard will automatically open.

  - If the TEI was found in outside the selected organisation unit, you
    will get the possibility to open the TEI.

For non-unique attributes search:

  - If no matching TEI's found, you will get the possibility to open the
    registration form.

  - If matching TEI's found, you can either click on any TEI in the
    result list, or open the registration form.

  - If a too large number of matches was found, you will be prompted to
    refine your search criteria

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_search_results.png)

The search results have functionality for flagging tracked entity instances
as possible duplicates, see next chapter.

When choosing to open the registration form, the search values will
automatically be filled into the registration form.

### Flagging tracked entity instance as potential duplicate

When searching for tracked entity instances in the tracker capture app, the user
will sometimes suspect that one or more of the search hits are duplicates of
other tracked entity instances. The user has the option of clicking on the
**flag possible duplicate** link in the rightmost column of the search result grid.

Tracked entity instances flagged in this way will be marked as "possible duplicate"
in the DHIS2 database. The flag indicates that the tracked entity instance is/has a
duplicate. The presence of such a flag is visible to the user in two places. One is
the result list itself (in this example Mark Robinson is already flagged as a potential
duplicate):

![Tracker capture search results](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracker_capture_search_results.png)

The other place is within the tracked entity instance dashboard:

![Tracked entity instance flagged as duplicate](resources/images/tracker_capture/tracked_entity_instance_flagged_as_duplicate.png)

In addition to informing users about the tracked entity instance potentially
being a duplicate, the  flag will be used by the underlying system for finding and
merging duplicates in coming versions of DHIS2.

### Breaking the glass

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:break_glass-->

If the program is configured with access level **protected**, and the
user searches and finds tracked entity instances that is owned by
organisation unit that the user does not have data capture authority
for, the user is presented with the option of breaking the glass. The
user will gove a reason for breaking the glass, then gain temporary
ownership of the tracked entity
instance.

## Enroll an existing TEI in a program

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:enroll_existing_tracked_entity_instance_in_program-->

1.  Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2.  Open an existing TEI dashboard.

3.  Select a program.

4.  In the **Enrollment** widget, click **Add new**.

5.  Fill in the required information and click **Enroll**.

## Enter event data for a TEI

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:enter_event_data_for_tracked_entity_instance-->

### Widgets for data entry

#### 

In a TEI dashboard, you enter event data in the **Timeline Data entry**
or **Tabular data entry** widgets.

<table>
<caption>Data entry widgets in the Tracker Capture app</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 31%" />
<col style="width: 68%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Widget name</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Timeline Data entry</strong></p></td>
<td><p>For data entry using either default or custom forms.</p>
<p>Depending on program definition, in particular program stages, events will be displayed in a timely fashion. Clicking on any of them displays the corresponding data entry. If a stage needs new event, a plus icon is displayed for new event creation. To proceed with data entry, it is mandatory to have event date. Once an event date is specified it is not possible to change due date. The assumption is that by specifying event date, the event has already taken place. If the event hasn't occurred yet, it is possible to change due date - this is effectively doing nothing but rescheduling. The buttons at the bottom help to change the status of a selected event.</p>
<p>Another key feature from this widget is addition of multiple notes for an event. Normally data recording is through data elements, however there are cases where it is necessary to record additional information or comments. This is where the notes section comes handy. However it is not possible to delete a note. The idea is notes are more like log books. Both skip-logic and validation error/warning messages are supported during data entry.</p>
<p>Also included in the Timeline Data entry is the option to compare your data entry to previous entries. This can be enabled by clicking the &quot;Switch to compare form&quot; button (Two sheets of paper) in the top right corner of the Timeline Data entry widget.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Tabular data entry</strong></p></td>
<td><p>For tabular-style data entry.</p>
<p>The widget displays the list of program stages as left-hand side labels. Events will be listed in table for repeatable program stage, and allows for in-line edits of event data values.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Creating an event

You can create an event for a TEI by:

1.  Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2.  Open an existing TEI dashboard.

3.  In the **Timeline Data entry** or **Tabular data entry** widget,
    click the **+**-button.

4.  Select a **Programstage** and set a **Report date**.

    Program stages can be configured to use a feature type.
    This makes it possible to capture geometry for an event.
    Supported feature type is Point and Polygon. Please see **How to use geometry**.

5.  Click **Save**.

### Schedule an event

You can shedule an event for a future date by:

1.  Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2.  Open an existing TEI dashboard.

3.  In the **Timeline Data entry** or **Tabular data entry** widget,
    click the **Calendar** icon.

4.  Select a **Programstage** and set a **Schedule date**.

5.  Click **Save**.

### Refer an event

Sometimes it might be nessascary to refer a patient to a different
**Organisation unit**. To refer a TEI:

1.  Open the **Tracker Capture** app.

2.  Open an existing TEI dashboard.

3.  In the **Timeline Data entry** or **Tabular data entry** widget,
    click the **Arrow** icon.

4.  Select a **Programstage**, **Organisation unit** and set a
    ****Report date****.

5.  Click either **One-time referral** which will only refer TEI for one
    single event or **Move permanently** which will move TEI ownership
    to the selected **Organisation Unit**. Further access to the TEI
    will be based on the ownership organisation unit.

### Mandatory data elements in events
Some data elements in an event might be mandatory (marked with a red star next to the data element lable).
What this means is that all mandatory data elements must be filled in before the user is allowed to complete the event.
The exception to this is if the user has the authority called __"Ignore validation of required fields in Tracker and Event Capture".__
If the user has this authority, the mandatory data elements will not be required to be filled in before saving and
the red star will not be displayed next to the data element lable. Note that super user that have the __"ALL"__ authority automatically
have this authority.

## How to use geometry

Tracked entity type, program and program stage can be configured to
use a feature type. This makes it possible to capture geometry for a
TEI, program or event. Supported feature types are Point and Polygon.

### Capture coordinate
**Option 1:** Fill in the latitude and longitude into the field.

**Option 2:**
1.  Click on the **map icon**
2.  Find the location you want by either searching or locating it on
    the map
3.  Right-click on the location you want, and choose **Set coordinate**
4.  Click **Capture** at the bottom

### Capture Polygon
1.  Click on the **map icon**
2.  Find the location you want by either searching or locating it on
    the map
3.  At the top left of the map, click the **polygon icon**
4.  Draw a polygon on the map. To finish, connect the last point with
    the first point
5.  Click **Capture** at the bottom

![](resources/images/tracker_capture/capture_geometry.png)

Polygons can also be deleted
1.  Click the **map icon**
2.  Click the **trash can icon** at the left side of the map, and select
    **Clear all**

## How to assign a user to an event

In the Maintenance App a program stage can be configured to allow user assignment.
If user assignment is enabled, you will be able to assign a user to an event.

1. Click the **Assigned user** field.
2. Scroll or search for a user.
3. Click the user.

## Manage a TEI's enrollments

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:manage_tracked_entity_instance_enrollment-->
The Enrollment widget gives access to information and functionality
for the enrollment in the selected program.

![Enrollments widget](resources/images/tracker_capture/enrollment_widget.png)

### TEI ownership

The current ownership of all enrollments in the selected program is displayed
in the "Owned by" part of the enrollment widget. The ownership will always start
out as the organisation unit that first enrolled the TEI into the given program.

Ownership can be different for a TEIS different programs, for example one clinic can
follow up a patient in HIV, while another clinic follows up the same patient in MCH.

To update the ownership for a TEI/program combination, the user has to utilize the
referral functionality and select the "Move permanently" option while referring.

A user that has capture access to the organisation unit that is the current owner of the
TEI/Program will have write access to all enrollments for that TEI/Program combination.
A user that has search access to the organisation unit that is the current owner will have
access to search and find the TEI/Program combindation.

on how the relationship type is configured, the relative can inherit
attributes.

Assume there are two programs: Antenatal care for the mother and
Immunization for the child. If first name, last name and address
attributes are required for both programs, it is possible to configure
last name and address attributes as inheritable. Then during child
registration, there is no need to enter these inheritable attributes.
You can add them automatically based on the mother's value. If you want
to have a different value for the child, you can override the
automatically generated value.

### Change table display mode for **Timeline Data Entry** widget

The **Timeline Data Entry** widget has 5 diffrent table display modes that can be selected. The different options are:
- **Default form** - Shows all data elements verticaly.

- **Compare form previous** - Shows the prevoius (repeatable) program stage next to the current selected program stage.

- **Compare form all** - Shows all prevoius (repeatable) program stages next to the current selected program stage.

- **Grid form** - Shows the data elements horizontaly.

- **POP-over form** - The same as **Grid form**, but when clicked the data elements are displayed in a pop-up.

To change the current display mode, click the second icon in the widgets top bar (see image below):

Once an option is selected the selection is stored for that spesific program stage. This mean that you can have different table modes for the different program stages in a program.  

> **Notes:**
> 1.  *The **Compare form** options will function best if you have multipe repeatable events (of the same program stage) present.*
> 2.  *The **Grid form** and **POP-over form** options are not selectable if the program stage has more than 10 data elements.*
> 3.  *The icon in the widgets bar will change depending on the option you have selected.*

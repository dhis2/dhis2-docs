## Viewing chart interpretations

When viewing a chart, you can expand the interpretations on the right
side by clicking on the Interpretations button in the upper right corner.
The chart description will also be shown.

To view the chart according to the date of a particular interpretation,
click on the interpretation. This will regenerate the chart with the
relevant date, which is indicated next to the chart title.

Clicking on the back arrow inside the interpretations panel will clear the
interpretation and regenerate the chart with the current date.

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_visualizer-->

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-overview.png)

## Creating and editing visualizations

When you open the data-visualizer app from the dhis2 menu, you are presented with a blank slate and you can start creating your visualization right away.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-new.png)

### Select visualization type

Select the desired visualization type from the selector in the upper left corner.
For each visualization type there is a brief description with suggestions about where to use the main dimensions in the layout.

### Select dimensions

From the dimensions menu on the left you can select the dimensions you want to show in your visualization, including data, period, organisation units and dynamic dimensions. These can be added by clicking on a dimension, by dragging and dropping a dimension to the layout area or by hovering over a dimension and using on its context menu (three dots).

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-dimensions.png)

Just like in the dimensions menu, in the layout area you can also change the selections by clicking on a dimension, dragging and dropping a dimension or by using a dimension's context menu (three dots).

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-layout-area.png)

- **Series**: A series is a set of continuous, related elements (for
  example periods or data elements) that you want to visualize in
  order to emphasize trends or relations in its data. Also known as Columns for Pivot table visualizations.

<!-- end list -->

- **Categories**: A category is a set of elements (for example indicators
  or organisation units) for which you want to compare its data. Also known as Rows for Pivot table visualizations.

<!-- end list -->

- **Filter**: The filter selection will filter the data displayed in the
  visualization. Note that if you use the data dimension as filter, you can
  only specify a single indicator or data set as filter item, whereas
  with other dimension types you can select any number of items.

### Select dimension items

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_vis_select_dim_items-->

A dimension refers to the elements that describe the data values in the system. There are three main dimensions in the system:

- **Data**: Includes data elements, indicators and datasets (reporting
  rates), describing the phenomena or event of the data.

<!-- end list -->

- **Periods**: Describes when the event took place.

<!-- end list -->

- **Organisation units**: Describes where the event took place.

Data Visualizer is highly flexible in terms of allowing you to use these dimensions as series, categories and filter.

To select items for a dimension, open the dimension modal window by clicking on a dimension. This window will also be opened automatically when adding a dimension without selected items to the layout. Select which items to add to the visualization by double-clicking an item or by selecting an item with a single click and using the arrows in the middle. The order of appearance will be the same as the order in which they are selected. Selected items can be reordered by dragging and dropping them in the Selected section.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-dimension-modal.png)

#### Select periods

When selecting a Period you have to option to choose between fixed periods and relative periods. These can also be combined. Overlapping periods are filtered so that they only appear once. For relative periods the names are relative to the current date, e.g. if the current month is March and **Last month** is selected, the month of February is shown in the visualization.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-period-dimension-modal.png)

#### Select organisation units

The organisation units dialog is flexible, offering essentially three ways of selecting organisation units:

- Explicit selection: Use the **tree** to explicitly select the organisation units you want to appear in the visualization. If you right-click on an organisation unit you can easily choose to select all org units below it.

- Levels and groups: The **Level** and **Group** dropdowns are a convenient way to select all units in one or more org unit groups or at specific levels. Example: select _Chiefdom_ (level 3) to get all org units at that level.

  Please note that as soon as at least one level or group has been selected the org unit tree now acts as the boundary for the levels/groups. Example: if you select _Chiefdom_ (level 3) and _Kailahun_ org unit (at level 2) in the tree you get all chiefdom units inside Kailahun district.

- The user's organisation units:

  - User organisation unit: This is a way to dynamically select the org units that the logged in user is associated to.

  - User sub-units: Selects the sub-units of the user organisation unit.

  - User sub-x2-units: Selects the units two levels below the user organisation unit.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-organisation-unit-dimension-modal.png)

### Two category charts

Most chart visualization types can show two categories.
Switching from Pivot Table to Column, Bar, Area (and their stacked versions) and Line is keeping the first two dimensions in Category, any additional dimension is moved to Filter.
The labels for the first dimension in Category are shown at the top of the chart, and the ones for the second dimension at the bottom.
The resulting visualization is composed of separate charts, one for each item in the first dimension.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-two-category.png)

## Change the display of your visualization

The display of a visualization can be changed by enabling/disabling and configuring several options. Each visualization type can have a different set of available options. The options are organised in tabs in the **Options dialog** and in sections within each tab.

1.  Click **Options** to open the **Options dialog**.

2.  Navigate the tabs in the dialog to see the available options.

3.  Configure the desired options as required.

4.  Click **Update** to apply the changes to the visualization.

### Custom styling for text and legend in charts

The following options can be customized using the text styling tool: `Chart title`, `Chart subtitle`, `Show legend key`, `Target line`, `Base line`, `Axis title` and `Labels` for both horizontal and vertical axes.
The text styling tool allows to choose a font size, color and italic/bold variants. It's also possible to choose the position of the text.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-text-styling-tool.png)

## Adding Assigned Categories

Assigned Categories is a composite dimension that represents associated category option combinations to the selected data element's category combination. This can be added by dragging the **Assigned Categories** dimension from the left side dimensions menu and into the visualization layout:

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-assigned-categories.png)

Another way of adding assigned categories is by accessing the **Add Assigned Categories** option from the `Data` dimension's context menu (not available for `Gauge`, `Year over year` or `Single value`).

## Adding more axes

When combining data with different measurement scales you will get a more meaningful visualization by having more than a single axis. For `Column`, `Bar`, `Area` and `Line` you can do so by clicking the **Series tab** in the `Options` dialog. If the option is disabled, make sure that the `Data` dimension is on the `Series` axis and that at least two items have been added.

Four axes are available, two on the left side (axis 1 and 3) of the chart and two on the right side (axis 2 and 4).
Each axis has a different color and the chart items are going to be colored accordingly.

Note: When multiple axes are in use, some options like `Lines`, `Vertical (y) axis` and `Color set` in the other option tabs will be disabled.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-series-tab-multi-axis.png)

## Using multiple visualization types

It's possible to combine a `Column` chart with `Line` items and vice versa. This is done by clicking the **Series tab** in the `Options` dialog and changing the `Visualization type`. This can also be combined with using multiple axes (as described in the section above).

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-series-tab-multi-axis-multi-type.png)

This results in a chart that combines the `Column` and `Line` types.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-multi-type-chart.png)

## Data drilling

This feature is enabled for the `Pivot Table` visualization type and allows to drill in the data by clicking on a value cell in the table. A contextual menu opens with various options.

You can drill the data by organisation unit, meaning navigating up and down the org unit tree. The data drill affects the current dimension selection in the layout area.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-pt-drill.png)

## Manage saved visualizations

Saving your visualizations makes it easy to find them later. You can also choose to share them with other users or display them on a dashboard.

### Open a visualization

1.  Click **File** \> **Open**.

2.  Enter the name of a visualization in the search field, or click the **<** and **>** arrows to navigate between different pages. The result can also be filtered by type and owner by using the corresponding menus in the top right corner.

3.  Click the name of the one you want to open.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-open-dialog.png)

### Save a visualization

1. a) Click **File** \> **Save**.

2. Enter a **Name** and a **Description** for your visualization.

3. Click **Save**.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-save-dialog.png)

### Rename a visualization

1.  Click **File** \> **Rename**.

2.  Enter the new name and/or description.

3.  Click **Rename**.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-rename-dialog.png)

### Delete a visualization

1.  Click **File** \> **Delete**.

2.  Click **Delete**.

### Get the link to the visualization

1. Click **File** \> **Get Link**.

2. The URL can be copied via the browser's context menu that opens when right clicking on the link.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-delete-dialog.png)

## Visualization interpretations

When viewing a saved visualization, you can expand the interpretations on the right side by clicking on the Interpretations button in the upper right corner. The visualization description will also be shown. The description supports rich text format.

New interpretations can be added by typing in the text field in the bottom right corner. Other users can be mentioned with `@username`. Start by typing `@` plus the first letters of the username or real name and a list of matching users will be displayed. Mentioned users will receive an internal DHIS2 message with the interpretation or comment. Interpretations can also be seen in the **Dashboard** app.

It is possible to format the text with **bold**, _italic_ by using the Markdown style markers `*` and `_` for **bold** and _italic_ respectively (keyboard shortcuts are also available: `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `B` and `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `I`). A limited set of emojis is supported and can be used by typing one of the following character combinations: `:)` `:-)` `:(` `:-(` `:+1` `:-1`. URLs are automatically detected and converted into a clickable link.

To view the visualization according to the date of a particular interpretation, click on the interpretation or its `View` button. This will regenerate the visualization with the relevant date, which is indicated next to the visualization title. Clicking on `Back to all interpretations` will regenerate the visualization with the current date.

To subscribe to the saved visualization, click the bell icon in the upper right corner. You will then receive internal messages whenever another user likes/creates/updates an interpretation in this saved visualization.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-view-interpretation.png)

## Share a visualization

Sharing settings can be accessed by clicking **File** \> **Share**. Change sharing settings for the user groups you want to modify, the available settings are:

- **Can edit and view**: Can view and edit the visualization.

- **Can view only**: Can only view the visualization.

- **No access**: Won't have access to the visualization. This
  setting is only applicable to **Public access** and **External access**.

New users can be added by searching for them by name under `Add users and user groups`.

![](resources/images/data-visualizer/data-visualizer-share-dialog.png)

## Download

Visualizations can be downloaded using the **Download** menu. All visualization types support `Graphics` and `Plain data source` downloads, except for the `Pivot table` type, which can be downloaded as `Table layout` and `Plain data source`.

### `Graphics` download

Downloads an image (.png) or a PDF (.pdf) file to your computer.

### `Table layout` download

Downloads a Excel (.xls), CSV (.csv) or HTML (.html) file to your computer.

### `Plain data source` download

You can download the data source of a visualization in JSON, XML, Excel,
CSV, JXRML or Raw data SQL formats with different identification schemes
(ID, Code, and Name). The data document uses identifiers of the
dimension items and opens in a new browser window to display the URL of
the request to the Web API in the address bar. This is useful for
developers of apps and other client modules based on the DHIS2 Web API
or for those who require a plan data source, for instance for import
into statistical packages.

## Adding more axes

When combining data with different measurement scales you will get a more meaningful visualization by having more than a single axis. For "column", "bar" and "line" charts you can do so by clicking "Manage axes" in the series dimension's context menu.

In the axis management dialog you can assign data items to the two axes.

## Viewing visualization interpretations

When viewing a visualization, you can expand the interpretations on the right
side by clicking on the Interpretations button in the upper right corner.
The visualization description will also be shown. The description suppots rich text format.

To view the visualization according to the date of a particular interpretation,
click on the interpretation or its "View" button. This will regenerate the visualization with the
relevant date, which is indicated next to the visualization title.

Clicking on "Back to all interpretations" or the "Exit View" button inside the interpretations panel will clear the
interpretation and regenerate the visualization with the current date.

## See visualization as map

Sometimes it can be useful to see how visualization would look like on map. To achieve this you can select "Open as Map" visualization type after you build your visualization.

## About programs

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_program_maintenance_app-->

Traditionally, public health information systems have been reporting
aggregated data of service provision across its health programs. This
does not allow you to trace the people provided with these services. In
DHIS2, you can define your own programs with stages. These programs are
a essential part of the "tracker" functionality which lets you track
individual records. You can also track other ‘entities’ such as wells or
insurances. You can create two types of programs:

<table>

To create a program, you must first configure several types of metadata
objects. You create these metadata objects in the **Maintenance** app.

## Configure event programs in the Maintenance app

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:configure_event_program_in_maintenance_app-->

### About event programs

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_event_program-->

Single event *without* registration programs are called event programs.
You configure them in the **Maintenance** app. Event programs can have
three types of data entry forms:

<table>
<caption>Types of data entry forms for event programs</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Form type</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Basic</p></td>
<td><p>Lists all data elements which belong to the program. You can change the order of the data elements.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Section</p></td>
<td><p>A section groups data elements. You can then arrange the order of the sections to create the desired layout of the data entry form.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Custom</p></td>
<td><p>Defines the data entry form as HTML page.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

> **Note**
>
>   - Custom forms takes precedence over section forms if both are
>     present.
>
>   - If no custom or section form are defined, the basic form will be
>     used.
>
>   - The Android apps only supports section forms.

You can create *program notifications* for event programs. The
notifications are sent either via the internal DHIS2 messaging system,
via e-mail or via text messages (SMS). You can use program notifications
to, for example, send an automatic reminder to a tracked entity 10 days
before a scheduled appointment. You use the program’s tracked entity
attributes (for example first name) and program parameters (for example
enrollment date) to create a notification template. In the
**Parameters** field, you'll find a list of available tracked entity
attributes and program parameters.

### Workflow: Create an event program

  - For legacy reasons, this is always the validation strategy for tracker programs, where each data value in the event is stored to the server while entrering data.
- **On update and insert**
  This option will enforce required field validation when saving the event to the server regardless of the completion status. When using this option no events can be stored without passing validations.

#### Assign data elements

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:assign_data_elements-->

1.  Click **Assign data elements**.

2.  In the list of available items, double-click the data elements you
    want to assign to the event program.

3.  (Optional) For each data element, add additional settings:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    <col style="width: 50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>

For example, for a numerical value you may select &quot;Default&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;, &quot;Slider&quot;, &quot;Linear scale&quot;, and &quot;Spinner&quot;.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p><strong>Desktop render type</strong></p></td>
    <td><p>WARNING: NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.</p>
    <p>Can be used to select different render types for desktop (i.e. the web interface). Available options vary depending on the data element's value type. For example, for a numerical value you may select &quot;Default&quot;, &quot;Value&quot;, &quot;Slider&quot;, &quot;Linear scale&quot;, and &quot;Spinner&quot;.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

4.  Click next.

#### Create data entry forms

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_data_entry_forms-->

The data entry forms decide how the data elements will be displayed to
the user in the **Event Capture** app.

1.  Click **Create data entry form**.

2.  Click **Basic**, **Section** or **Custom**.

3.  To create a **Basic** data entry form: Drag and drop the data
    elements in the order you want.

4.  To create a **Section** data entry form:

    1.  Click the add button and enter a section's name, description and
        render type for desktop and mobile.

    2.  Click the section so it's highlighted by a black line.

    3.  Add data elements by clicking the plus sign next to the data
        elements' names.

    4.  Repeat above steps until you've all the sections you need.

    5.  Change the section order: click the options menu, then drag the
        section to the place you want.

5.  To create a **Custom** data entry from: Use the WYSIWYG editor to
    create a completely customized form. If you select **Source**, you
    can paste HTML code directly in the editing area. You can also
    insert images for example flags or logos.

6.  Click next.

#### Access

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:access-->

Access options decide who can capture data for the program or view/edit
the program's metadata. A program can be shared to organisation units,
and in addition, the main program and any program stages' access options
can be configured through the **Sharing dialog**. Access options are
available in the **Access** tab.

Assign organization units:

1.  In the organisation tree, double-click the organisation units you
    want to add to the program to.

    You can locate an organisation unit in the tree by expanding the
    branches (click on the arrow symbol), or by searching for it by
    name. The selected organisation units display in orange.

Change roles and access:

1.  Scroll down to the **Roles and access** section.

    The first row shows the main program's access options, and each
    subsequent row shows the options of one program stage. Program
    stages with a warning icon (exclamation mark) contain access options
    that deviate from the main program, meaning they are accessed by a
    different combination of users.

2.  Click on either of the rows and the **Sharing dialog** will show.

3.  Modify the access options accordingly. See documentation on the
    sharing dialog for details.

4.  Click the **Apply** button.

5.  Repeat the process for each program/program stage. You can also copy
    all access options from the main program to your child programs:

    1.  Select the program stages you want to have similar access
        options as the main program by toggling the checkboxes on the
        right hand side of the program stages. You can also choose to
        **Select all** program stages, **Deselect all** program stages
        or **Select similar** stages, in terms of access options, to
        that of the main program. Similar stages are toggled by default.

    2.  Click **Apply to selected stages**

#### Create program notifications

1.  Create the message you want to send:

    1.  Click **What to send?**.

    2.  Enter a **Name**.

    3.  Create the **Subject template**: Double-click the parameters in
        the **Template variables** field to add them to your subject.

        > **Note**
        >
        > The subject is not included in text messages.

    4.  Create the **Message template**: Double-click the parameter
        names in the **Template variables** list to add them to your
        message.

## Configure tracker programs in the Maintenance app

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:configure_tracker_program_in_Maintenance_app-->

### About Tracker programs
Single or multiple event programs *with* registration are called Tracker programs. A program must be specified with only one tracked entity. Only tracked entities that are the same as the tracked entity of program can enroll into that
program. A program needs several types of metadata that you create in the **Maintenance** apps.

### Workflow: Create a tracker program

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:workflow_tracker_program-->

1.  Enter the tracker program details.

2.  Enter enrollment details.

3.  Assign attributes and create  **section** or **custom** registration form.

4. Create program stages.

5. Configure access, and assign to organisation units.

6. Create program and program stage notification(s).

### Create or edit a Tracker program

1. Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program**.

2. Click the add button and select **Tracker Program** in the popup menu.

#### Enter program details

> Changes to a program stage is not saved until you save the program.

1. Click the plus sign to create a program stage.
2. Enter program stage details:
    1. Enter a **Name**.
    2.  (Optional) select a **Color** and an **Icon** that will be used
by the data capture apps to identify this program stage.
    3. Enter a **Description**.
    4. In the **Scheduled days from start** field, enter the minimum
number of days to wait for starting the program stage.
3. Enter repeatable program stage details.
    1. Specify if the program stage is **Repeatable** or not.
    2. Select a **Period type**.
    3. Clear **Display generate event box after completed** if you 
    don't want to display *Create new event box* to create new event

6. Create data entry forms for program stage

    The data entry forms decide how the data elements will be displayed to
    the user in the **Tracker Capture** app.

   1.  Click **Create data entry form**.

   2.  Click **Basic**, **Section** or **Custom**.

   3.  To create a **Basic** data entry form: Drag and drop the data
       elements in the order you want.

   4.  To create a **Section** data entry form:

       1.  Click the add button and enter a section's name, description and
           render type for desktop and mobile.

       2.  Click the section so it's highlighted by a black border.

       3.  Add data elements by clicking the plus sign next to the data
           elements' names.

       4.  Repeat above steps until you've all the sections you need.

       5.  Change the section order: click the options menu, then drag the
           section to the place you want.

   5.  To create a **Custom** data entry from: Use the WYSIWYG editor to
           create a completely customized form. If you select **Source**, you
           can paste HTML code directly in the editing area. You can also
           insert images for example flags or logos.

   6.  Click add stage.


#### Access

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:tracker_program_access-->

Access options decide who can capture data for the program or view/edit
the program's metadata. A program can be shared to organisation units,
and in addition, the main program and any program stages' access options
can be configured through the **Sharing dialog**. Access options are
available in the **Access** tab.

Assign organization units:

1.  In the organisation tree, double-click the organisation units you
    want to add to the program to.

    You can locate an organisation unit in the tree by expanding the
    branches (click on the arrow symbol), or by searching for it by
    name. The selected organisation units display in orange.

Change roles and access:

1.  Scroll down to the **Roles and access** section.

    The first row shows the main program's access options, and each
    subsequent row shows the options of one program stage. Program
    stages with a warning icon (exclamation mark) contain access options
    that deviate from the main program, meaning they are accessed by a
    different combination of users.

2.  Click on either of the rows and the **Sharing dialog** will show.

3.  Modify the access options accordingly. See documentation on the
    sharing dialog for details.

4.  Click the **Apply** button.

5.  Repeat the process for each program/program stage. You can also copy
    all access options from the main program to your child programs:

    1.  Select the program stages you want to have similar access
        options as the main program by toggling the checkboxes on the
        right hand side of the program stages. You can also choose to
        **Select all** program stages, **Deselect all** program stages
        or **Select similar** stages, in terms of access options, to
        that of the main program. Similar stages are toggled by default.

    2.  Click **Apply to selected stages**

#### Create program notifications

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_tracker_program_notifications-->

You can create program notifications for programs with registration and
their program stages. The notifications are sent either via the internal
DHIS2 messaging system, via e-mail or via text messages (SMS). You can
use program notifications to, for example, send an automatic reminder to
a tracked entity 10 days before a scheduled appointment. You use the
program’s tracked entity attributes (for example first name) and program
parameters (for example enrollment date) to create a notification
template.


1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program and then
    notifications**.

    A list of existing program notifications for the selected program
    opens. If the program doesn't have any program notifications, the
    list is empty.

2.  Click on add button and select **Program notification**.

3.  Enter a **Name**.

4.  Create the **Subject template**.

    Double-click the parameters in the **Parameters** field to add them
    to your subject.

    > **Note**

    > The subject is not included in text messages.

5.  Create the **Message template**.

    Double-click the parameter names in the **Parameters** field to add
    them to your message.

### About program indicators

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_program_indicators-->

Program indicators are expressions based on data elements and attributes
of tracked entities which can be used to calculate values based on a
formula. Program indicators consist of an aggregation type, an analytics
type, an expression and a filter.

Program indicators are evaluated based on the assigned aggregation type,
expression and filter. The order of evaluation is:

1.  The *filter* will filter the events which become part of the
    evaluation/aggregation routine.

2.  The *expression* will be evaluated per event.

3.  All evaluated expression values will be *aggregated* according to
    the aggregation type of the program indicator.

<ul>
<li><p>Average</p></li>
<li><p>Average (number)</p></li>
<li><p>Average (number, disaggregation)</p></li>
<li><p>Average (sum in organisation unit hierarchy)</p></li>

<li><p>Average (Yes/No)</p></li>
<li><p>Count</p></li>
<li><p>Custom</p>
<p>The &quot;custom&quot; aggregation type allows you to specify the aggregation type in-line in the expression. All other aggregation  types are applied to the entire expression.</p>
<p>Using the &quot;custom&quot; aggregation type might lead to an exception of the order of evaluation described above where individual parts of the expression can be evaluated and aggregated, as opposed to the entire expression being evaluated prior to aggregation.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Events implies a data source where each event exists as an independent row. This is suitable for performing aggregations such as counts and sums.</p></li>
<li><p>Enrollments implies a data source where all events for a single enrollment is combined on the same row. This allows for calculations which can compare event data from various program stages within a program enrollment.</p></li>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Analytics period boundaries</p></td>
<td><p>Defines the boundaries for the program indicator calculation. The boundaries determine which events or enrollments gets included in aggregations, always relative to the aggregate reporting period start and end. When creating the program indicator, the default boundaries will get preselected based on analytics type.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For analytics type <em>event</em>, the default boundaries will be configured to encapsulate any events with an event date after the reporting period starts and before the reporting period ends.</p></li>
<li><p>For analytics type <em>enrollment</em>, the default boundaries will encapsulate all enrollments with an enrollment date after the reporting date starts and before the reporting period ends. In addition, the default enrollment program indicator evaluates the newest event for all program stages regardless of date.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to change the upper and lower boundaries to include a longer or shorter period relative to the reporting period, or delete one of the boundaries - in effect returning all data before or after a certain period. It is also possible to add more constraints, for example to make an enrollment program indicator only include event data up to a given point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Boundary target: Can be <em>incident date</em>, <em>event date</em>, <em>enrollment date</em> or <em>custom</em>. Designates what is being constrained by the boundary.</p>
<p><em>custom</em> is used make boundary that target either a date data element, tracked entity attribute or the presence of an event in a program stage. This is done with a custom expression on the form:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data element of type date: #{programStageUid.dataElementUid}.</p>
<pre><code>#{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Tracked entity attribute of type date: #{attributeUid}.</p>
<pre><code>A{GPkGfbmArby}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Presence of one event in a specific program stage: PS_EVENTDATE:programStageUid.</p>
<pre><code>PS_EVENTDATE:A03MvHHogjR</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
This boundary target is only applicable to
Analytics type Enrollment
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Analytics period boundary type: Defines whether the boundary is an end boundary - starting with &quot;before...&quot;, or a start boundary - &quot;after...&quot;. Also defines whether the boundary relates to the end of the aggregate reporting period or the start of the aggregate reporting period.</p></li>
<li><p>Offset period by amount: In some cases, for example cohort analytics, the boundary should be offset relative to the aggregate reporting period when running pivots and reports. The offset period by amount is used to move the current boundary either back(negative) or forward(positive) in time. The amount and period type together will determine how big the offset will be. An example can be when making a simple enrollment cohort program indicator for a 1 year cohort, it might be enough to offset each boundary of the program indicator with &quot;-1&quot; and &quot;Years&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Period type: See above. Can be any period, e.g. <em>Weekly</em> or <em>Quarterly</em>.</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Expression</p></td>
<td><p>The expression defines how the indicator is being calculated. The expression can contain references to various entities which will be substituted with a related values when the indicator is calculated:</p>

<li><p>Data elements: Will be substituted with the value of the data element for the time period and organisation unit for which the calculation is done. Refers to both program stage and data element.</p></li>
<li><p>Attributes: Will be substituted with the value of the attribute for the person / tracked entity for which the calculation is done.</p></li>

<td><p>Filter</p></td>
<td><p>The filter is applied to events and filters the data source used for the calculation of the indicator.

If the filter evaluates to true then the event is included later in the expression evaluation, if not it is ignored. The filter can, in a similar way as expressions, contain references to data elements, attributes and constants.</p>
<p>The program indicator filter can in addition use logical operators. These operators can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately evaluate to either true or false. For example you can assert that multiple data elements must be a specific value, or that specific attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant.</p></td>

An expression which uses the custom aggregation type and hence can use
inline aggregation types looks like
    this:

    (sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.K0A4BauXJDl} * #{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH}) / sum(#{mCXR7u4kNBW.NFkjsNiQ9PH})) * 100

Note how the "sum" aggregation operator is used inside the expression
itself.

#### Functions to use in a program indicator expression or filter

The program indicator expression and filter support a range of
functions. The functions can be applied to data elements and attributes:

These operators can be used to form logical expressions which ultimately
evaluate to either true or false. For example you can assert that
multiple data elements must be a specific value, or that specific
attributes must have numerical values less or greater than a constant.

A filter that uses both attributes and data elements looks like this:

    A{cejWyOfXge6} == 'Female' and #{A03MvHHogjR.a3kGcGDCuk6} <= 2

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:configure_program_rule-->

### About program rules

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_program_rules-->

Program rules allows you to create and control dynamic behaviour of the
user interface in the **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture** apps.
During data entry, the program rules expressions are evaluated each time
the user interface is displayed, and each time a data element is
changed. Most types of actions will take effect immediately when the
user enters values in the **Tracker Capture** and **Event Capture**
apps.

<table>
<caption>Program rule components</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />

<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Program rule component</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Program rule action</p></td>
<td><p>Each program rule contains one or multiple actions. These are the behaviours that are triggered in the user interface when the expression is true. Actions will be applied at once if the expression is true, and will be reverted if the expression is no longer true. There are several types of actions and you can have several actions in one program rule.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Program rule expression</p></td>
<td><p>Each program rule has a single expression that determines whether the program rule actions should be triggered, if the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is true the program rule is in effect and the actions will be executed. If the expression is false, the program rule is no longer in effect and the actions will no longer be applied.</p>
<p>You create the expression with standard mathematical operators, custom functions, user-defined static values and program rule variables. The program rule variables represent attribute and data element values which will be evaluated as part of the expression.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Program rule variable</p></td>
<td><p>Program rule variables lets you include data values and attribute values in program rule expressions. Typically, you'll have to create one or several program rule variables before creating a program rule. This is because program rules expressions usually contain at least one data element or attribute value to be meaningful.</p>
<p>The program rule variables are shared between all rules in your program. When you create multiple program rules for the same program, these rules will share the same library of program rule variables.</p></td>

### Workflow

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:workflow_program_rule-->

1.  In the **Maintenance** app, create program rule variable(s) if
    needed.

2.  In the **Maintenance** app, create the program rule:

    1.  Enter the program rule details.

    2.  Create the program rule expression.

    3.  Define the program rule actions.

3.  In the **Tracker Capture** or **Event Capture** apps, verify that
    the program rule behaves as expected.

### Create or edit a program rule variable

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_program_rule_variable-->

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program rule
    variable**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  Select a **Program** and enter a **Name**.

4.  Select if you want to **Use code for option set**.

    This option is only effective when the data element or tracked
    entity attribute is connected to an option set. If you don't select
    this option, the program rule variable will be populated with the
    option set's name. If you select the option, the program rule
    variable will be populated with the option set's code instead.

5.  Select a **Source type** and enter the required information.

    Depending on the source type, you'll have to select, for example, a
    **Program stage,** **Data element** or **Tracked entity attribute**.

    The source types determine how the program rule variable is
    populated with a value.

    <p><strong>Tracker Capture</strong>: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value collected for the given data element within the enrollment.</p>
    <p><strong>Event Capture</strong>: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value found within the 10 newest events in the same organisation unit.</p>

    <td><p>Program rule variables with this source type will contain the value from a specified data element from a previous event. Only older events is evaluated, not including the event that the user currently has open.</p>
    <p>This source type is commonly used when a data element only should be collected once during an enrollment, and should be hidden in subsequent events.</p>
    <p>Another use case is making rules for validating input where there is an expected progression from one event to the next - a rule can evaluate whether the previous value is higher/lower and give a warning if an unexpected value is entered.</p>
    <p>This source type is populated slightly differently in <strong>Tracker Capture</strong> and <strong>Event Capture</strong> apps:</p>
    <p><strong>Tracker Capture</strong>: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value collected for the given data element within the enrollment - but only evaluating the events that comes before the current event date.</p>
    <p><strong>Event Capture</strong>: the program rule variable will be populated with the newest data value collected within the 10 events preceding the current event date - not including the current event.</p>

    <p>These variables will not be persisted and will stay in memory only during the exectution of the set of program rules.

### Create or edit a program rule

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_program_rule-->

> **Note**
>
> A program rule belongs to exactly one program.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Program
    rule**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  Enter the program rule details. These fields are not shown to the
    end user, they are only meant for the program administrator.

      - **Program**

      - **Trigger rule only for program stage**

        If a program stage is selected, the program rule will only run for the selected program stage,
        as opposed to being run for every program stage in the program.

      - **Name**

      - **Description**

      - **Priority**

        Let's say you have 16 program rules in your program. You
        configure the program rules with the following priority
        settings:

          - Priority 1 for program rule A

          - Priority 2 for program rules B - K

          - No priority for program rules L - P

        Result: the system runs the program rules in the following
        order:

        1.  Program rule A

        2.  Program rules B - K (you can't find out or configure in
            which order the system runs these program rules)

        3.  Program rules L - P.

4.  Click **Enter program rule expression** and create the program rule
    expression with the help of variables, functions and operators.

5.  Click **Define program rule actions** and create the actions
    executed when the expression is true.

    1.  Click the add button, select an **Action** and enter the
        required information.

        Depending on the action type, you'll have to perform different
        types of settings. For some action types, you must also enter
        free text or create expressions.

### Example: Program rules

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:program_rule_examples-->

> **Note**
>
> You can view all examples on the demo server:
> <https://play.dhis2.org/dev/dhis-web-maintenance/#/list/programSection/programRule>

This example shows how to configure a program rule which calculate
number of weeks and days in a pregnancy and display the result in the
format the clinician is used to see it in. The calculation is based on
previous recorded
    data.

2.  ![](resources/images/maintainence/pg_rule_ex/keyvaluepair_expression.png)

3.  ![](resources/images/maintainence/pg_rule_ex/keyvaluepair_action.png)

    The full expression in the **Data** field:

        d2:concatenate(d2:weeksBetween(#{lmp}, V{current_date}), '+',
        d2:modulus(d2:daysBetween(#{lmp}, V{current_date}), 7))

![](resources/images/maintainence/pg_rule_ex/keyvaluepair_result.png)

This example shows how to configure a program rule to display text in
the Feedback widget in the **Tracker Capture**
    app.

4.  ![](resources/images/maintainence/pg_rule_ex/displaytext_action.png)

![](resources/images/maintainence/pg_rule_ex/displaytext_result.png)

This example shows how to configure a program rule to always display
certain data in the Feedback widget in the **Tracker Capture** app. This
is useful when you want to make sure that vital data, for example
medicine allergies, is always
    visible.

By using a program rule of type "Assign value" you can calculate the
"Gestational age at visit" value and fill it in the data entry form. You
configure the program rule to calculate "Gestational age at visit" based
on either "LMP date" or "Ultrasound estimated due
date".

### Reference information: Operators and functions to use in program rule expression

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:program_rules_operators_functions-->

> **Tip**
>
> You can nest functions within each other and with sub-expressions to
> form more complex conditions. An example that produces the gestational
> age in weeks, based on last menstrual date:
>
>     d2:floor( d2:daysBetween(#{lastMenstrualDate},V{event_date}) / 7 )

> **Tip**
>
> The source type will determine how the d2: function calls will
> evaluate a (sourcefield) parameter.
>
> Example: where \#{hemoglobinCurrent} is set to source type **Data
> element in current event**. The following function call with evaluate
> whether haemoglobin is entered in the current event.
>
>     d2:hasValue( 'hemoglobinCurrent' )
>
> Example: where \#{hemoglobin} is set to source type **Data element
> from the newest event in the current program**. The following function
> call with evaluate whether there exists a value for the haemoglobin in
> any event in the enrollment.
>
>     d2:hasValue( 'hemoglobin' )
>
> Example: where \#{hemoglobinPrevious} is set to source type **Data
> element from previous event** . The following function call with
> evaluate whether there exists a value for the haemoglobin among the
> events preceding the current event.

## Configure relationship types

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:configure_relationship_type-->

### About relationship types

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_relationship_types-->

A relationship represents a link between two entities in the Tracker-model. A relationship is considered data in DHIS2 and is based on a Relationship Type, similar to how a Tracked Entity Instance is based on a Tracked Entity Type.

Relationships always include two entities, and these entities can include Tracked Entity Instances, Enrollments and Events, and any combination of these. Note that not all of these combinations are available in the current apps.

In addition, relationships can be defined as unidirectional or bidirectional. The only functional difference is currently that these requires different levels of access to create. Unidirectional relationships requires the user to have data write access to the “from” entity and data read access for the “to” entity, while bidirectional relationships require data write access for both sides.

For more information about configuration and the meaning of 'From constraint' and 'To constraint', see [Relationship model](relationship_model#relationship_model_relationship_type).

### Create or edit a relationship type

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_relationship_type-->

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Relationship
    type**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  Type a **Name** of the relationship type.

4.  (Optional) Assign a **Code**.

5.  (Optional) Provide a **Description** of the relationship.

6. (Optional) Select whether the relationship should be bidirectional

7. Provide **Relationship name seen from inititating entity**. This is the name of the relationship that will be shown in the Data Entry app at the 'left' side of the relationship. E.g. in a Mother-child relationship this could be 'Mother of'.

8. (Optional) Provide **Relationship name seen from receiving entity**. This is the name of the relationship that will be shown at the 'right' side of the relationship in the Data Entry app. E.g. in a Mother-child relationship this could be 'Mother'.

9.  Select a 'From constraint'. This limits what kind of entities that can be included in the relationship. [Relationship model](relationship_model#relationship_model_relationship_type).

10. Select a 'To constraint'. This limits what kind of entities that can be included in the relationship. [Relationship model](relationship_model#relationship_model_relationship_type).

11. Click **Save**.

## Configure tracked entity types

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:configure_tracked_entity-->

### About tracked entity types

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:about_tracked_entity-->

A tracked entity is a types of entities which can be tracked through the
system. It can be anything from persons to commodities, for example a
medicine or a person.

A program must have one tracked entity. To enroll a tracked entity
instance into a program, the tracked entity type and tracked
entity type of a program must be the same.

Tracked entity attributes are used to register extra information for a
tracked entity. Tracked entity attributes can be shared between
programs.

### Create or edit a tracked entity attribute

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_tracked_entity_attribute-->

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Tracked
    entity attribute**.

2.  Click the add button.

3.  In the **Name** field, type the tracked entity attribute name.

4.  (Optional) Type a **Short name**.

4.  (Optional) Type a **Form name**.

5.  (Optional) In the **Code** field, assign a code.

6.  (Optional) Type a **Description**.

7. (Optional) In the **Field mask** field, you may type a template that's used to provide
   hints for correct formatting of the attribute. **NOTE: So far only implemented in the DHIS2 Android Capture app, not in the Capture and Tracker Capture web apps.**
   The following are special characters that can be used in the mask. The special characters match exactly one character of the given type.

   | Character     |    Match       |
   | ------------- |----------------|
   |      \\d      |     digit      |
   |      \\x      |lower case letter|
   |      \\X      | capital letter |
   |      \\w      |any alphanumeric character|

  For example, the pattern can be used to show hyphens as needed in the input field of the data element. E.g "\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d, would 
  show an hyphen for every third digit.

8.  Select an **Option set**.

9.  In the **Value type** field, select the type of data that the
    tracked entity attribute will record.

10. Select **Unique** to specify that the values of the tracked entity
    attribute is unique.

    There are two options for the unique setting:

      - **Entire system**: The values of the tracked entity attribute
        can duplicate with values which belong to other tracked entity
        attributes. But the values in this tracked entity attribute must
        not duplicate.

        Select **Automatically generated** to allow automatic generation
        of the tracked entity attribute value. When the generate setting
        is selected on, an optional field for specifying pattern also
        displays. This field should contain a pattern based on the
        TextPattern syntax. When the value is automatically generated,
        it will be unique for this attribute for the entire system. See
        the TextPattern section for more information on how it works.

      - **Organisation unit**: The values of the tracked entity
        attribute must not duplicate in the same organisation unit.

11. Select **Inherit** to registry a new entity for relationship with an
    available entity, all inherit entity attribute values of the entity
    will be pre-filled in the registration form.

12. (Optional) Select **Confidential**.

    This option is only available if you have configured encryption for
    the system.

13. (Optional) Select **Display in list without program**.

14. (Optional) Assign one or multiple **Legends**.

15. Click **Save**.

### Create or edit a tracked entity type

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:create_tracked_entity-->

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and click **Program** \> **Tracked
    entity type**.

2.  Click the add button or an already existing **tracked entity
    type**.

3.  Type a **Name** of the tracked entity.

4.  (Optional) select a **Color** and an **Icon** that will be used by
    the data capture apps to identify this tracked entity type.

5.  (Optional) Enter a **Description** of the tracked entity.

6.  (Optional) Enter a **Minimum number of attributes required to
    search**. This specifies the amount of attributes that need to be
    filled out in order to be able to search for this **tracked entity
    type** in a *global search*. See [Configure
    Search](../search/search.xml#configure_search) for more information.

7.  (Optional) Enter a **Maximum number of tracked entity instances to
    return in search**. This specifies the amount of tracked entity
    instances that will be returned in a *global search*. See [Configure
    Search](../search/search.xml#configure_search) for more information.

8.  (Optional) Add **Tracked entity type attributes**. This is used to
    configure search, see [Configure
    Search](configure_search) for more information.

9.  (Optional) Enter an **Alternative name** of the tracked entity.

10. Click **Save**.

## Configure search

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:configure_search-->

Users can be given search organisation units, which makes it possible to
search for tracked entity instances outside their data capture
organisation units.

Searching can be done either in the context of a program, or in the
context of a tracked entity type. To be give users the option of
searching in the context of a program, it is necessary to configure
which of the programs tracked entity attributes is searchable. To give
users the option of searching in the context of a tracked entity type,
you will have to configure which of the tracked entity type attributes
is searchable.

### Configure search for tracker program

To be able to search with a program, you will have to make some of the
program attributes searchable. Unique program attributes will always be
searchable.

1.  Open **Program app**

2.  Open or create a tracker program

3.  Go to **Attributes**

4.  If you have no attributes, add one

5.  Set the attribute searchable

Searchable program attributes will assigned to a search group.

  - Unique group. One group per unique program attribute. Unique
    attributes cannot be combined with other program attributes in a
    search. The result from the search can only be 0 or 1 tracked entity
    instance.

  - Non-unique group. This group contains all non-unique program
    attributes and makes it possible to combine multiple attributes in a
    search.

There are two limits that can be set for a program search, as part of
the **Program** configuration.

  - Minimum number of attributes required to search: This property
    defines how many of the non-unique attributes that must be entered
    before a search can be performed.

<!-- end list -->

  - Maximum number of tracked entity instances to return: This property defines how specific a search must be, by limiting the number of matching tracked entity instances a user is allowed to get for her search criteria. If the number of matching records is larger than this maximum, they will not be returned. The user must provide more specific search criteria, in order to reduce the number of matching records, before they are returned.
  
    > **NOTE**
    > 
    > This maximum is only applied to search results outside the users capture org unit. Within the capture scope, the user can see any number of results.

### Configure search for tracked entity type

> **Note**
>
> TET = Tracked entity type

To be able to search without a program, you will have to make some of
the TET attributes searchable. Unique TET attributes will always be
searchable.

1.  Open **Tracked entity type app**

2.  Open a Tracked entity type

3.  If the TET has no attributes, add one

4.  Set the attribute searchable

Searchable TET attributes will assigned to a search group.

  - Unique group. One group per unique TET attribute. Unique attributes
    cannot be combined with other TET attributes in a search. The result
    from the search can only be 0 or 1 tracked entity instance.

  - Non-unique group. This group contains all non-unique TET attributes
    and makes it possible to combine multiple attributes in a search.

There are two limits that can be set for a TET search

  - Minimum number of attributes required to search: This property
    defines how many of the non-unique attributes that must be entered
    before a search can be performed.

<!-- end list -->

  - Maximum number of tracked entity types to return: This property defines how specific a search must be, by limiting the number of matching tracked entity types a user is allowed to get for her search criteria. If the number of matching records is larger than this maximum, they will not be returned. The user must provide more specific search criteria, in order to reduce the number of matching records, before they are returned.
  
    > **NOTE**
    > 
    > This maximum is only applied to search results outside the users capture org unit. Within the capture scope, the user can see any number of results.

### Configure search organisation units for a user

To be able to search in other organisation units than the users data
capture organisation units, the user must be assigned with search
organisation units. Giving a user a search organisation unit will also
give it access to search in all children of that organisation unit.

1.  Open **Users app**

2.  Click on a user

3.  Open **Assign search organisation units**

4.  Select organisation units

5.  Click **Save**

## Clone metadata objects

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:clone_metadata-->

Cloning a data element or other objects can save time when you create
many similar objects.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and find the type of metadata object
    you want to clone.

2.  In the object list, click the options menu and select **Clone**.

3.  Modify the options you want.

4.  Click **Save**.

## Delete metadata objects

> **Note**
>
> You can only delete a data element and other data element objects if
> no data is associated to the data element itself.

> **Warning**
>
> Any data set that you delete from the system is irrevocably lost. All
> data entry forms, and section forms which may have been developed will
> also be removed. Make sure that you have made a backup of your
> database before deleting any data set in case you need to restore it
> at some point in time.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and find the type of metadata object
    you want to delete.

2.  In the object list, click the options menu and select **Delete**.

3.  Click **Confirm**.

## Change sharing settings for metadata objects

You can assign different sharing settings to metadata objects, for
example organisation units and tracked entity attributes. These sharing
settings control which users and users groups that can view or edit a
metadata object.

Some metadata objects also allows you to change the sharing setting of
data entry for the object. These additional settings control who can
view or enter data in form fields using the metadata.

> **Note**
>
> The default setting is that everyone (**Public access**) can find,
> view and edit metadata objects.

1.  Open the **Maintenance** app and find the type of metadata object
    you want to modify.

2.  In the object list, click the context menu and select **Sharing
    settings**.

3.  (Optional) Add users or user groups: search for a user or a user
    group and select it. The user or user group is added to the list.

4.  Change sharing settings for the access groups you want to modify.

      - **Can edit and view**: The access group can view and edit the
        object.

      - **Can view only**: The access group can view the object.

      - **No access** (only applicable to **Public access**): The public
        won't have access to the object.

5.  Change data sharing settings for the access groups you want to

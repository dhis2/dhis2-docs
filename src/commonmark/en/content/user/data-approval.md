# Data approval

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approval-->

DHIS2 has an optional feature that allows authorized users to approve
data that has been entered. It allows data to be reviewed and approved
at selected levels in the organisation unit hierarchy, so the approval
follows the structure of the hierarchy from lower levels to higher
levels.

Data is approved for a combination of (a) period, (b) organisation unit
and (c) workflow. Data may be approved for the organisation unit for
which it is entered, as well as for higher-level organisation units to
which the data is aggregated. As part of system settings, you can choose
the organisation unit level(s) at which data is approved. It can be
approved at higher levels only after it has been approved for all that
organisation unit's descendants at lower levels for the same workflow
and period. When you approve a workflow, it approves data for any data
sets that have been assigned to that workflow.

After a period, organisation unit and workflow combination has been
approved, data sets associated with that workflow will be locked for
that period and organisation unit, and any further data entry or
modification will be prohibited unless it is first un-approved.

For example, the following diagram illustrates that data has already
been approved for organisation units C and D, for a given period and
workflow. It may now be approved for organisation unit B for the same
period and workflow. But it is not ready to be approved for organization
unit A. Before it can be approved for organisation unit A, it must be
approved for B, and for any other children of organisation unit A, for
that period and workflow.

## Approving and accepting

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approvals_approving_accepting-->

DHIS2 supports two different types of approval processes: either a
one-step process where the data is approved at each level, or a two-step
process where data is first approved and then accepted at each level.
This is illustrated in the following diagram:

![Approving and
accepting](resources/images/data_approval/approval_level_steps.png){.center width=69% }

In the one-step process, data is approved at one level, and then
approved at the next higher level. Until it is approved at the next
higher level, it may be unapproved at the first level. (For example, if
the data was approved my mistake, this allows the approver to undo their
mistake.) Once the data is approved at the next higher level, it may not
be unapproved at the lower level unless it is first unapproved at the
higher level.

In the two-step process, data is approved at one level, and then the
approval is accepted at the same level. This acceptance is done by a
user who is authorized to approve data at the next higher level. Once
the data is accepted, it may not be changed or unapproved unless it is
first *unaccepted*.

The two-step process is not required by DHIS2. It is an optional step
for a user reviewing data at the next higher level. It has the benefit
of locking the acceptance from the level below, so reviewer does not
have to worry that the data could be changing from below while it is
being reviewed. It can also be used by the higher-level user to keep
track of which lower-level data has already been reviewed.

Two-step process can be activated by checking **Acceptance required
before approval** in SystemSettings app under General section.



## Authorities for approving data

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approvals_authorities-->

To approve data, you must be assigned a role containing one of these
authorities:

  - **Approve data** - You may approve data for the organisation unit(s)
    to which you are assigned. Note that this authority does not allow
    you to approve data for lower-levels below the organisation unit(s)
    to which you are assigned. This is useful to separate the users
    authorized to approve at one level from the users authorized to
    approve at levels below.

  - **Approve data at lower levels** - Allows you to approve data for
    all lower levels below the organisation units assigned to you. This
    is useful if, for example, you are a district-level user whose role
    includes approving the data for all the facilities within that
    district, but not for the district itself. If you are assigned this
    as well as the *Approve data* authority, you may approve data at the
    level of the organisation unit(s) to which you have been assigned,
    and for any level below.

  - **Accept data at lower levels** - Allows you to accept data for the
    level just below the organisation unit(s) assigned to you. This
    authority can be given to the same users as approve data. Or it may
    be given to different users, if you want to have some users who
    accept data from the level below, and a different set of users who
    approve data to go up to the next level above.

## Configuring data approval

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approvals_configuration-->

In the *Maintenance app* section under *Data approval level* you can
specify the levels at which you want to approve data in the system.
Click the Add new button on this page and select the organisation unit
level at which you want approvals. It will be added to the list of
approval settings. You may configure the system for approving data at
every organisation unit level, or only at selected organisation unit
levels.

Note that when you add a new approval level, you may optionally choose a
Category option group set. This feature is discussed later in this
chapter.

Also in maintenance under *Data approval workflow*, you can define the
workflows that will be used for approving data. Each workflow can be
associated with one or more approval levels. Any two workflows may
operate at all the same approval levels as each other, some of the same
and some different levels, or completely different levels.

If you want data for a data set to be approved according to a workflow,
then assign the workflow to the data set when you add or edit the data
set. If you do not want data for a data set to be subject to approval,
then do not assign any workflow to that data set. For data sets that you
want to approve at the same time as each other, assign them to the same
workflow. For data sets that you want to approve independently, assign
each data set to its own workflow.

On the *System Approval Settings* page, you may select the option *Hide
unapproved data in analytics* to hide unapproved data in reports, pivot
table, data visualizer and GIS. If this option is checked, unapproved
data will be hidden from users assigned to higher-level organisation
units compared to where approval is required. Users who are assigned to
organisation units where data is ready for approval can still view the
data, as can users assigned to higher-level organisation units if they
have the *Approve data at lower levels* authority. If this option is not
checked, then all data is shown whether approved or not.

## Data visibility

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approvals_data_visibility-->

If the option *Hide unapproved data in analytics* is enabled, data will
be hidden from viewing by users associated with higher levels. When
determining whether a data record should be hidden for a specific user,
the system associates a user with a specific approval level and compares
it to the level to which the data record has been approved up to. A user
is associated with the approval level which matches the level of the
organisation unit(s) she is linked to, or if no approvel level exists at
that level, the next approval level linked to an organisation unit level
below herself. A user will be allowed to see data which has been
approved up to the level immediately below her associated approval
level. The rationale behind this is that a user must be ablet to view
the data that has been approved below so that she can eventually view
and approve it herself.

Note that if the user has been granted the *View unapproved data* or the
*ALL* authority she will be able to view data irrespective of the
approval status.

*Lets consider the following example:* There are four organisation unit
levels, with approval levels associated with level 2 and 4. *User A* at
country level (1) gets associated with approval level 1 since the
approval level exists at the same level as the organisation unit level.
*User B* gets associated with approval level 2 since there is no
approval level directly linked to her organisation unit level and
approval level 2 is the immediate level below. *User C* gets associated
with approval level 2. *User D* is below all approval levels which
implies that she can see all data entered at or below her organisation
unit level.

![Hiding of unapproved
data](resources/images/data_approval/approval_data_hiding.png){.center}

Using this example, lets consider some scenarios:

  - Data is entered at facility level: Only *User D* can see the data,
    as the data has not yet been approved at all.

  - Data is approved by *User D* at facility level: Data becomes visible
    to User C and User B, as the data is now approved at their level.

  - Data is approved by *User C* at district level: Data becomes visible
    to User A, as data is now approved at the level immediately below
    herself.



## Approving data

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approvals_approving_data-->

To approve data, go to *Reports* and choose *Data Approval*. When this
report shows data that is configured for approval, it shows the approval
status of the data in the report. The approval status will be one of the
following:

  - **Waiting for lower level org units to approve** - This data is not
    yet ready to be approved, because it first needs to be approved for
    all the child organisation units to this organisation unit, for the
    same workflow and period.

  - **Ready for approval** - This data may now be approved by an
    authorized user.

  - **Approved** - This data has already been approved.

  - **Approved and accepted** - This data has already been approved, and
    also accepted.

If the data you are viewing is in an approval state that can be acted
upon, and if you have sufficient authority, one or more of the following
actions will be available to you on the *Data Approval* form:

  - **Approve** - Approve data that has not yet been approved, or that
    was formerly approved and has been unapproved.

  - **Unapprove** - Return to an unapproved state data that has been
    approved or accepted.

  - **Accept** - Accept data that has been approved.

  - **Unaccept** - Return to an unaccepted (but still approved) state
    data that has been accepted.

In order to unapprove data for a given organisation unit, you must have
the authority to approve data for that organisation unit or to approve
data for a higher-level organisation unit to which that data is
aggregated. The reason for this is as follows: If you are reviewing data
for approval at a higher organisation unit level, you should consider
whether the data at lower organisation units are reasonable. If all
lower-level data looks good, you can approve the data at the higher
level. If some lower-level data looks suspect, you can unapprove the
data at the lower level. This allows the data to be reviewed again at
the lower level, corrected if necessary, and re-approved up through the
organisation unit levels according to the hierarchy.

## Approving by category option group set

<!--DHIS2-SECTION-ID:data_approvals_approving_by_cogs-->

When defining an approval level, you specify the organisation unit level
at which data will be approved. You may also optionally specify a
category option group set. This is useful if you are using category
option groups to define additional dimensions of your data, and you want
approvals to be based on these dimensions. The following examples
illustrate how this can be done within a single category option group
set, and by using multiple category option group sets.

### Approving by one category option group set

For example, suppose you define a category option group set to represent
NGOs who serve as healthcare partners at one or more organisation units.
Each category option group within this set represents a different
partner. The category option group for Partner 1 may group together
category options (such as funding account codes) that are used by that
partner as a dimension of the data. So data entered by Partner 1 is
attributed to a category option in Partner 1's category option group.
Whereas data entered by partner 2 is attributed to a category option in
Partner 2's category option group:

<table align="center">
<caption>Example Category Option Groups</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Category option group set</th>
<th>Category option group</th>
<th>Category options</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Partner</td>
<td>Partner 1</td>
<td>Account 1A, Account 1B</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Partner</td>
<td>Partner 2</td>
<td>Account 2A, Account 2B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Each partner could enter data for their accounts independently of the
other, for the same or different workflows, at the same or different
facilities. So for example, data can be entered and/or aggregated at the
following levels for each partner, independently of each other:

![Example category option
groups](resources/images/data_approval/approval_partner_example.png){.center}

> **Tip**
> 
> You can use the sharing feature on category options and category
> option groups to insure that a user can enter data (and/or see data)
> only for certain category options and groups. If you don't want users
> to see data that is aggregated beyond of their assigned category
> options and/or category option groups, you can assign *Selected
> dimension restrictions for data analysis*, when adding or updating a
> user.

You can optionally define approval levels for partner data within any or
all of these organisation unit levels. For example, you could define any
or all of the following approval levels:

<table align="center">
<caption>Example Category Option Group Set approval levels</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Approval level</th>
<th>Organisation unit level</th>
<th>Category option group set</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Country</td>
<td>Partner</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>District</td>
<td>Partner</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Facility</td>
<td>Partner</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



## Approving by multiple category option group sets

You can also define approval levels for different category option group
sets. To continue the example, suppose that you have various agencies
that manage the funding to the different partners. For example, Agency A
funds accounts 1A and 2A, while Agency B funds accounts 1B and 2B. You
could set up category option groups for Agency A, and Agency B, and make
them both part of a category option group set called Agency. So you
would have:

<table align="center">
<caption>Example Multiple Category Option Group Sets</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Category option group set</th>
<th>Category option group</th>
<th>Category options</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Partner</td>
<td>Partner 1</td>
<td>Account 1A, Account 1B</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Partner</td>
<td>Partner 2</td>
<td>Account 2A, Account 2B</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Agency</td>
<td>Agency A</td>
<td>Account 1A, Account 2A</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Agency</td>
<td>Agency B</td>
<td>Account 1B, Account 2B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Now suppose that at the country level, you want each partner to approve
the data entered by that partner. Once this approval is done, you want
each agency to then approve the data from accounts that are managed by
that agency. Finally, you want to approve data at the country level
across all agencies. You could do this by defining the following
approval levels:

<table align="center">
<caption>Example Multiple Category Option Group Set approval levels</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Approval level</th>
<th>Organisation unit level</th>
<th>Category option group set</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Country</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Country</td>
<td>Agency</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Country</td>
<td>Partner</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that multiple approval levels can be defined for the same
organisation unit level. In our example, Partner 1 would approve
country-wide data at approval level 3 from category options Account 1A
and Account 1B. Next, Agency A would approve country-wide data at
approval level 2 from category options Account 1A (after approval by
Partner 1) and Account 2A (after approval by Partner 2.) Finally, after
approval from all agencies, country-wide data can be approved at
approval level 1 across all category options. Note that approval level 1
does not specify a category option group set, meaning that it is for
approving data across all category options.

This example is meant to be illustrative only. You may define as many
category option groups as you need, and as many approval levels as you
need at the same organisation unit level for different category option
group sets.

If you have multiple approval levels for different category option group
sets at the same organisation unit level, you may change the approval
ordering in the *Settings* section, under *System Approval Settings*.
Just click on the approval level you wish to move, and select *Move up*
or *Move down*. If you have an approval level with no category option
groups set, it must be the highest approval level for that organisation
unit level.

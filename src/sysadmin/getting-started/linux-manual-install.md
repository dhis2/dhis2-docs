# Manual Install on Ubuntu Server { #getting_started_linux_manual_install }

## Introduction { #install_server_setup } 
This guide explains how to manually install DHIS2 on Ubuntu 22.04
with PostgreSQL and Tomcat as the server. It also suggests
using a proxy (like nginx or Apache) and monitoring tools (like Munin or
Zabbix) for enhanced performance. Although all components can be hosted
separately, this guide focuses on a simple, single-server setup.

This guide is intended mainly as a reference for general installation
practices. Setup steps can vary depending on factors like operating system,
database choice, and other configurations. It is therefore, strongly
recommended that some automation be used for the install, and for production
setups, refer to [Automated install on Ubuntu](#getting_started_linux_automated_install)

For optimum performance, it is recommended that you allocate PostgreSQL database
more that half of the available RAM, and the remaining half be shared between
your dhis2 instances, and some Operating  System. The steps marked as
*optional*, like the step for performance tuning, can be done at a later stage.

Here, the term `invoke` refers to running a command directly in the terminal.

## Prerequisites 
* Server running Ubuntu 22.04
* SSH Access with `non-root` user with `sudo` privileges

## Creating a user to run DHIS2 { #install_creating_user } 
DHIS2 on Tomcat should never be run as the `root` user. Instead, create a
standard user and use it to run the Tomcat instance to enhance security.,

> **Important**
>
> You should not run the DHIS2 server as a privileged user such as root.

* Create a dhis2 system user 
   ```sh
   sudo useradd -d /home/dhis -m dhis -s /bin/false
   ```

* Set the password for the created user
   ```sh
   sudo passwd dhis
   ```
   Make sure you set a strong password with at least 15 random characters.

## Creating the configuration directory { #install_creating_config_directory } 
* Create config directory for the DHIS2 instance. This directory will also be
  used for apps, files and log files. 
   ```sh
   sudo -u dhis mkdir /home/dhis/config
   ```
* DHIS2 will look for an environment variable called `DHIS2_HOME` to locate the
  DHIS2 configuration directory. This directory will be referred to as
  `DHIS2_HOME` in this installation guide. We will define the environment
  variable in a later step in the installation process.
* If no environment variable `DHIS2_HOME` is found, the default configuration
  file location `/opt/dhis2` is used.

## Setting server timezone and locale { #install_setting_server_tz } 
* It may be necessary to reconfigure the time zone of the server to match the
  time zone of the location which the DHIS2 server will be covering. If you are
  using a virtual private server, the default time zone may not correspond to
  the time zone of your DHIS2 location. You can easily reconfigure the time
  zone by invoking the below and following the instructions.
   ```sh
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
   ```

* PostgreSQL is sensitive to locales so you might have to install your locale
  first. To check existing locales and install new ones (e.g. English US):
   ```sh
   locale -a
   sudo locale-gen en_US.utf8
   ```

## PostgreSQL installation { #install_postgresql_installation } 

Install PostgreSQL with below steps

*  Add PostgreSQL repository
   ```sh
   sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
   ```
* Import the PostgreSQL repository signing key:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc|sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg
   ```
* Update the package lists 
   ```sh
   sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y 
   ```
* Install PostgreSQL 16
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-16 postgresql-16-postgis-3
   ```

*  Ensure postgresql is started and enabled
   ```
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   sudo systemctl enable postgresql
   ```

* Create a non-privileged database user `dhis` with the `command` below:
   ```sh
   sudo -u postgres createuser -SDRP dhis
   ```
   Enter a secure password at the prompt:

   > **Note**
   >
   > This database user and password will be used by your DHIS2 application to
   > connect to the database. You will need to write down this user and password
   > in the  `dhis.conf`  file at a later stage.

*  Create a database named `dhis` owned by `dhis` database user by invoking:
   ```sh
   sudo -u postgres createdb -O dhis dhis;
   ```
* The *PostGIS* extension is needed for several GIS/mapping features to work.
   DHIS2 will attempt to install the PostGIS extension during startup, but its
   not gonna work because dhis user is not superuser. For adding trigram
   indexes and compounding it with primitive column types, two extensions have
   to be created in the database for DHIS 2 verision 2.38 and later. The
   extensions are already part of the default posgresql installation: Since
   DHIS2 database user does not have permission to create extensions, create
   them from the console using the `postgres` user with the following commands:
   ```sh
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "create extension postgis;" dhis
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "create extension btree_gin;" dhis
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "create extension pg_trgm;" dhis
   ```
   Check [PostgreSQL Performance Tuning](#install_postgresql_performance_tuning) for optimization parameters.
<!-- Exit the console and return to your previous user with *\\q* followed by -->
<!-- *exit*. -->
## Java installation { #install_java_installation } 
---
| DHIS2 version | JDK recommended | JDK required | Tomcat Required | 
|:--------------|:---------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|  
| 2.41          | 17              | 17           | 8.5.50          |
| 2.40          | 17              | 11           | 8.5.50          |
| 2.38          | 11              | 11           | 8.5.50          |
| 2.35          | 11              | 8            |                 |
| Pre 2.35      | 8               | 8            |                 |

The recommended Java JDK for DHIS2 2.40 and above is OpenJDK 17, its required for 2.41. 
```
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk
```
The recommended Java JDK for DHIS2 2.35 - 2.40 is OpenJDK 11. Install it by invoking command below, 
```
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk
```
For dhis2 versions below 2.35, OpenJDK 8 is required. Install it by invoking command below, 
```
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk
```
Verify that your installation is correct by invoking:
```
java -version
```

## DHIS2 configuration { #install_database_configuration } 

The database connection information is provided to DHIS2 through a
configuration file, `dhis.conf`. Create this file and save it in
the `DHIS2_HOME` directory. As an example this location could be:

```sh
sudo -u dhis touch /home/dhis/config/dhis.conf
```

A configuration file for PostgreSQL corresponding to the above setup has
these properties:

Edit the file and add the content looking like below, 

```
sudo -u dhis vim /home/dhis/config/dhis.conf
```
 
```properties
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Database connection
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# JDBC driver class
connection.driver_class = org.postgresql.Driver

# Database connection URL
connection.url = jdbc:postgresql:dhis

# Database username
connection.username = dhis

# Database password
connection.password = xxxx
```

### Tomcat and DHIS2 installation { #install_tomcat_dhis2_installation } 

*  To install the Tomcat servlet container we will utilize the Tomcat user
   Install it with below command,
   ```
   sudo apt-get install -y tomcat9-user
   ```
   This package allows creating a new Tomcat instance. The instance will
   be created in the current directory. An appropriate location is the home
   directory of the `dhis` user:
*  Use below command to create an instance named `tomcat-dhis` in `/home/dhis/tomcat-dhis` directory
   ```
   sudo tomcat9-instance-create /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis
   sudo chown -R dhis:dhis /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/
   ```
   > **Note** 
   >
   > `tomcat9-user` package allows for creating any number of DHIS2 instances if
   > that is desired.

*  Edit the file `/home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/bin/setenv.sh` and append below lines
   at the end for the file. 
   `sudo -u dhis vim /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/bin/setenv.sh`
   ```
   export JAVA_HOME='/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/'
   export JAVA_OPTS='-Xms3g -Xmx6g'
   export DHIS2_HOME='/home/dhis/config'
   ```
      * `JAVA_HOME` sets the location of the JDK installation.
      * `JAVA_OPTS` passes parameters to the JVM.
         * `-Xms` sets the initial allocation of memory to the Java heap memory space.
         * `-Xmx` sets the maximum allocation of memory to the Java heap memory space. This should reflect how much memory you would like to allocate to the DHIS2 software application on your server.
      * `DHIS2_HOME` sets the location of the `dhis.conf` configuration file for DHIS2.
   Check that the path the Java binaries are correct as they might vary from
   system to system, e.g. on AMD systems you might see
   `/java-11-openjdk-amd64`. Note that you should adjust these values to your
   environment.

* DHIS2 should never be run as a privileged user. After you have modified the
  `setenv.sh` file, modify the `startup.sh` script to check and verify that the
  script has not been invoked as root.
  ```
   sudo -u dhis vim  /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/bin/startup.sh
  ```
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  set -e
  
  if [ "$(id -u)" -eq "0" ]; then
    echo "This script must NOT be run as root" 1>&2
    exit 1
  fi
  
  export CATALINA_BASE="/home/dhis/tomcat-dhis"
  /usr/share/tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
  echo "Tomcat started"
  ```

*  The Tomcat configuration file is located in
   `/home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/conf/server.xml`. The element which defines the
   connection to DHIS is the *Connector* element with port 8080. You can change
   the port number in the Connector element to a desired port if necessary. The
   `relaxedQueryChars` attribute is necessary to allow certain characters in
   URLs used by the DHIS2 front-end.
   ```xml
   <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
     connectionTimeout="20000"
     redirectPort="8443"
     relaxedQueryChars="[]" />
   ```

*  The next step is to download the DHIS2 WAR file and place it into the
   _webapps_ directory of Tomcat. You can download DHIS2 WAR files from the
   following location: 
   ```sh
   https://releases.dhis2.org/
   ```
   An example of how do download dhis2 version v40.3.0
   ```
   wget -O dhis.war https://releases.dhis2.org/40/dhis2-stable-40.3.0.war
   ```
   Move the WAR file into the Tomcat `webapps` directory. We want to call the
   WAR file `ROOT.war` in order to make it available at `localhost` directly
   without a context path: Using war file downloaded with above wget example: 

   ```sh
   sudo mv dhis.war /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/webapps/ROOT.war
   ```

## Running DHIS2 { #install_running_dhis2 } 

*  Start the DHIS2 instance with the command below:
   ```sh
   sudo -u dhis /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/bin/startup.sh
   ```

> :bulb: **Important**
> 
> The DHIS2 server should never be run as root or other privileged user.

* Check the logs live:
   ```
   tail -f /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/logs/catalina.out
   ```

* To stop the DHIS2 instance:
   ```sh
   sudo -u dhis /home/dhis/tomcat-dhis/bin/shutdown.sh
   ```

* If the WAR file deployed in `webapps` is named  ROOT.war, you can now access your DHIS2 instance at the following URL:

    http://localhost:8080

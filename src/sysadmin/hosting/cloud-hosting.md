# Cloud Hosting

## Introduction

Cloud server hosting offers a compelling alternative to traditional physical server deployments. In this model, cloud service providers provision virtual server instances, often referred to as cloud servers or virtual machines (VMs). These VMs are not tied to specific hardware but rather operate within a cloud computing environment. This environment typically spans a network of interconnected data centers, offering robust infrastructure and scalability on demand.

## Cloud servers

The Ministry of Health (MoH) utilizes a cloud-based approach for its server infrastructure. This method, known as **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS), involves acquiring server resources from a commercial cloud provider like Linode, AWS, Contabo, or Azure. Under this model, the MoH pays only for the specific resources (computing power, storage, etc.) it consumes, offering flexibility and cost-efficiency.

### Advantages

- Usually the lowest cost option relative to Physical Hosting
- Can provide better performance and reliability
- Only System Administrator skills are required

### Drawbacks

- Potential payment challenges for MoH (means of payment)
- Budgeting challenges for recurring payments

> **Note**:
>
> Most cloud services work on credit card basis, which is often not a good match for government procurement (paying for it can be a barrier). UiO has relationships with some providers (such as Linode) that allows countries to pay up front by wire transfer, which can make this a more viable option.

## Cloud (Software as service)

The Ministry of Health (MoH) leverages a Software as a Service (SaaS) model for its DHIS2 deployment. This approach involves obtaining DHIS2 software and its associated infrastructure from a commercial cloud provider specializing in DHIS2 solutions. Examples of such providers include BAO, BlueSquare, and HISP South Africa.

### Advantages

- Provider manages system setup and administration (no need to employ a system administrator)
- Reduced IT Burden: SaaS eliminates the need for MoH to manage server infrastructure or software updates, minimizing IT resource requirements.
- Most security concerns are handled by the provider
- Service-level agreements for performance and stability
- Potentially Lower Costs: Compared to traditional deployment models, SaaS can offer lower upfront costs and predictable pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Drawbacks

- More expensive than infrastructure-as-a-service (though savings in staff cost)
- Potential payment challenges for MoH (means of payment)
- Budgeting challenges for recurring payments

> **Note**
>
> Similar to the previous mode, these services require regular, recurring payments to the service provider. Management processes need to be in place to manage the budget and ensure bills are paid.

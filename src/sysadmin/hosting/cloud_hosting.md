# Cloud Hosting
## Introduction
Cloud server hosting refers to the provision of virtual server instances (known
as cloud servers or virtual machines) by a cloud service provider. Instead of
running on physical hardware, these virtual servers are deployed and managed in
a cloud computing environment, typically within a network of interconnected
data centers.

## Cloud servers ( Infrastructure as a service )
MOH has an account with a commercial cloud company and pays for the use of server resources.
(ex: Linode, AWS, Contabo, Azure):

#### Pros
- Usually the lowest cost option
- Can provide better performance and reliability
- Only System Administrator skills are required

#### Cons
- Potential payment challenges for MoH (means of payment)
- Budgeting challenges for recurring payments

> Note:
>
> Most cloud services work on credit card basis, which is often not a good
> match for government procurement (paying for it can be a barrier). UiO has
> relationships with some providers (such as Linode) that allows countries to
> pay up front by wire transfer, which can make this a more viable option.


## Cloud (Software as service)
DHIS2 software as a service - (ex: BAO, BlueSquare, HISP South Africa): MOH has
an account with a commercial cloud company which offers DHIS2-as-a-service.

#### Pros: 
- Provider manages system setup and administration (no need to employ a system administrator)
- Most security concerns are handled by the provider
- Service-level agreements for performance and stability

#### Cons:
- More expensive than infrastructure-as-a-service (though savings in staff cost)
- Potential payment challenges for MoH (means of payment)
- Budgeting challenges for recurring payments

> Note: 

> Similar to the previous mode, these services require regular, recurring
> payments to the service provider. Management processes need to be in place to
> manage the budget and ensure bills are paid.

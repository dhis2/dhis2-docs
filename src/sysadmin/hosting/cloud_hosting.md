# Cloud Hosting
## Introduction
Cloud server hosting refers to the provision of virtual server instances (known
as cloud servers or virtual machines) by a cloud service provider. Instead of
running on physical hardware, these virtual servers are deployed and managed in
a cloud computing environment, typically within a network of interconnected
data centers.

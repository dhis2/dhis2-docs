# New folder structure

This folder contains only the documentation related to the **obsolete** Android Apps (Event Capture and Tracker Capture). The documentation for the current App has been migrated to its own [repository](https://github.com/dhis2/dhis2-android-capture-app/tree/master/docs).

The *_INDEX.md files for new documentation related to this App should point to specific subfolders on that repository.
